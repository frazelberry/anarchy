<P>CHAPTER XXIX, THE RATIONAL STATE</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(A) THE STATE ITSEIF; LAW AND OFFICIALDOM</P>

<P>The state in the sense of the rational state has existed only
in the western world.  Under the old regime in China a thin stratum
of so-called officials, the mandarins, existed above the unbroken
power of the clans and commercial and industrial guilds.  The
mandarin is primarily a humanistically educated literatus in the
possession of a benefice but not in the least degree trained for
administration; he knows no jurisprudence but is a fine writer,
can make verses, knows the age-old literature of the Chinese and
can interpret it.  In the way of political service no importance
is attached to him.  Such an official, performs no administrative
work himself; administration lies rather in the hands of the chancery
officials.  The mandarin is continually transferred from one place
to another to prevent his obtaining a foothold in his administrative
district, and he could never be assigned to his home province.
 As he does not understand the dialect of his province he cannot
communicate with the public.  A state with such officials is something
different from the Occidental state. (338)</P>

<P>In reality everything is based on the magical theory that the
virtue of the empress and the merits of the officials, meaning
their perfection in literary culture, keep things in order in
normal. times.  If a drought sets in or any untoward event takes
place an edict is promulgated intensifying the examinations in
verse-making, or speeding up legal trials in order to quiet the
spirits.  The empire is an agrarian state; hence the power of
the peasant clans who represent nine-tenths of the economic life-the
other onetenth belonging to commercial and trading guild organizations-is
entirely unbroken.  In essence things are left to take care of
themselves.  The officials do not rule but only interfere in the
event of disturbances or untoward happenings.(338, 339)</P>

<P>Very different is the rational state in which alone modern
capitalism can flourish.  Its basis is an expert officialdom and
rational law.  The Chinese state changed over to administration
through trained officials in the place of humanistically cultured
persons as early as the 7th and -llth centuries but the change
could be only temporarily maintained; then the usual eclipse of
the moon arrived aiid arrangements were transformed in reverse
order. It cannot be seriously asserted, however, that the spirit
of the Chinese people could not tolerate an administration of
specialists.  Its development, and that of the rational state,
was rather prevented by the persistence of reliance upon magic.
 In consequence of this fact the power of the clans could not
be broken, as happened in the occident through the development
of the cities and of Christianity. (339)</P>

<P>The rational law of the modern Occidental state, on the basis
of which the trained official renders his decisions, arose on
its formal side, though not as to its content, out of Roman law.
 The latter was to begin with a product of the Roman city state,
which never witnessed the dominion of democracy and its justice
in the same form as the Greek city.  A Greek heliast court administered
a petty justice; the contestants worked upon the judges through
pathos, tears, and abusing their opponents.  This procedure was
also known in Rome in political trials, as the orations of Cicero
show, but not in civil trials where the praetor appointed an index
to whom he gave strict instructions as to the conditions requiring
a judgment against the accused or the throwing out of the case.
 Under Justinian the Byzantine bureaucracy brought order and system
into this rational law, in<BR>
consequence of the natural interest of the official in a law which
would be systematic and fixed and hence easier to learn. (339,
340)</P>

<P>With the fall of the Roman empire in the west, law came into
the hands of the Italian notaries.  These, and secondarily the
universities, have on their conscience the revival of Roman law.
 The notaries adhered to the old contractual forms of the Roman
empire and re-interpreted them according to the needs of the time.
 At the same time a systematic legal doctrine was developed in
the universities.  The essential feature in the development, however,
was the rationalization of procedure.  As among all primitive
peoples the ancient German legal trial was a rigidly formal affair.
 The party which pronounced wrongly a single word in the formula
lost the case, because the formula possessed magical significance
and supernatural' evils were feared.  This magical formalism of
the German trial fitted in with the formalism of Roman law.  At
the same time the French kingdom played a<BR>
part through the creation of the institution of the representative
or advocate whose task it was especially to pronounce the legal
formulas correctly, particularly in connection with the canon
law.  The magnificent administrative organization of the church
required fixed forms for its disciplinary ends in relation to
the laity and for its own internal discipline.  No more than the
bourgeoisie could it take up with the Germanic ordeal or judgment
of God.  The business man could not permit commercial claims to
be decided by a competition in reciting formulas, and everywhere
secured exemptions from this legalistic contest and from the ordeal.
 The church also, after hesitating at first, ended by adopting
the view that such procedure was heathenish and not to be tolerated,
and established the canonical procedure on lines as rational as
possible.  This two-fold rationalization of procedure from the
profane and spiritual sides spread over the western world.(340,
341)</P>

<P>In the revival of the Roman law has been seen the basis for
the downfall of the peasant class, as well as for the development
of capitalism.  It is true that there were cases in which the
application of Roman law principles was disadvantageous to the
peasant.  An example is the transformation of the old mark community
rights into feudal obligations, the individual who stood at the
head of the mark community (Obermarker) being recognized as a
proprietor in the Roman sense and the holdings of the associates
burdened with feudal dues.  On the other hand, however, it was
especially through the jurists trained in the Roman law that in
France the kingdom was able to obstruct the eviction of peasants
by the lords. (341)</P>

<P>As little is the Roman law the basis without qualification
for the development of capitalism.  England, the home of capitalism,
never accepted the Roman  law, f or the reason that in connection
with the royal courts existed a class of advocates who guarded
the national legal institutions against corruption.  This class
controlled the development of legal doctrine, for from its ranks
were chosen, as they still are, the judges.  It prevented Roman
law from being taught in English universities, in order that persons
from outside the class might not reach the judicial bench. (341)</P>

<P>In fact all the characteristic institutions of modern capitalism
have other origins than Roman law.  The annuity bond, whether
arising out of a personal debt or a war loan, came from medieval
law,  in which Germanic legal ideas played their part.  Similarly
the stock certificate arose out of medieval and modern law and
was unknown to the law of antiquity.  Likewise the bill of exchange,
to the development of which Arabic, Italian, German, and English
law contributed.  The commercial company is also a medieval product;
only the commenda enterprise was current in antiquity.  So also
the mortgage, with the security of registration, and the deed
of trust, as well as the power of attorney, are medieval in origin
and do not go back to antiquity. (341, 342)</P>

<P>The reception of the Roman law was crucial only in the sense
that it created formal juristic thinking.  In its structure every
legal system is based either on formal legalistic or on material
principles.  By material principles are to be understood utilitarian
and economic considerations, such for example as those according
to which the Islamic cadi conducts his administration.  In every
theocracy and every absolutism justice is materially directed
as by contrast in every bureaucracy it is formal-legalistic. 
Frederick the Great hated the jurists because they constantly
applied in a formalistic sense his decrees which were based on
material principles, and so turned them to ends with which he
would have nothing to do.  In this conneetion, as in general,
the Roman law was the means of crushing the material legal system
in favor of the formal. (342)</P>

<P>This formalistic law, is however, calculable.  In China it
may happen that a man who has sold a house to another may later
come to him and ask to be taken in because in the meantime he
has been impoverished.  If the purchaser refuses to heed the ancient
Chinese command to help a brother, the spirits will be disturbed;
hence the impoverished seller comes into the house as a renter
who pays no rent.  Capitalism cannot operate on the basis of a
law so constituted.  What it requires is law which can be counted
upon, like a machine; ritualistic-religious and magical considerations
must be excluded. (342, 343)</P>

<P>The creation of such a body of law was achieved through the
alliance between the modern state and the jurists for the purpose
of making good its claims to power.  For a time in the 16th century
it attempted to work with the humanists, and the first Greek gymnasia
were established with the idea that men educated in them would
be suitable for state officials; for political contests were carried
out to a large extent through the exchange of state papers and
only one schooled in Latin and Greek had the necessary equipment.
 This illusion was shortlived.  It was soon found that the products
of the gymnasia were not on that account alone equipped for political
life, and the jurists were the final resort.  In China, where
the humanistically cultured mandarin ruled the field, the monarch
had no jurists at his disposal, and the struggle among the different
philosophical schools as to which of them formed the best statesmen
waged to and fro until finally orthodox Confucianism was victorious.
 India also had writers but no trained jurists.  In contrast the
western world had at its disposal a formally organized legal system,
the product of the Roman genius, and officials trained in this
law were superior to all others as technical administrators. 
From the standpoint of economic history this fact is significant
in that the alliance between the state and formal jurisprudence
was indirectly favorable to capitalism. (343)</P>

<P>(B) THE ECONOMIC POLICY OF' THE RATIONAL STATE</P>

<P>For the state to have an economic policy worthy of the name,
that is one which is continuous and consistent, is an institution
of exclusively modern origin.  The first system which it brought
forth is mercantilism, so-called. Before the development of mercantilism
there were two widespread commercial policies, namely, the dominance
of fiscal interests and of welfare interests, the last in the
sense of the customary standard of living. (343, 344)</P>

<P>In the east it was essentially ritualistic considerations,
including caste and clan organizations, which prevented the development
of a deliberate economic policy.  In China, the political system
had undergone extraordinary changes.  The country had an epoch
of highly developed foreign trade, extending as far as India.
 Later, however, the Chinese economic policy turned to external
exclusiveness to the extent that the entire import and export
business was in the hands of only 13 firms and was<BR>
concentrated in the single port of Canton.  Internally, the policy
was dominated by religious considerations; only on occasion of
natural catastrophes were abuses inquired into.  At all times
the question of co-operation of the provinces determined the viewpoint,
and a leading problem was set by the question whether the needs
of the state should be provided by taxation or through compulsory
services. (344) </P>

<P>In Japan, the feudal organization led to the same consequences
and resulted in complete exclusiveness as regards the outer world.
 The object was here the stabilization of class relations; it
was feared that foreign trade would disturb conditions as to the
distribution of property.  In Korea, ritualistic grounds determined
the exclusive policy.  If foreigners, that is profane persons,
were to come into the country the wrath of the spirits was to
be feared.  In the Indian middle ages we find Greek and Roman
merchants, as well as Roman soldiers, and also the immigration
of Jews with grants of privileges to them; but these germs were
unable to develop, for later everything was again stereotyped
by the caste system, which made a planned economic policy impossible.
 An additional consideration was that Hinduism strongly condemned
traveling abroad; one who went abroad had<BR>
on his return to be re-admitted to his caste. (344, 345)</P>

<P>In the occident down to the 14th century a planned economic
policy had a chance to develop only in connection with the towns.
 It is true that there were beginnings of an economic policy on
the part of the princes; in the Carolingian period we find price
fixing and public concern for welfare expressed in various directions.
 But most of this remained on paper only, and with the exception
of the coinage reform and the system of weights and measures of
Charlemagne, everything disappeared without leaving a trace in
the succeeding period.  A commercial policy which would have been
gladly adopted in relation to the orient was rendered impossible
by the absence of shipping. (345)</P>

<P>When the state under its prince gave up the fight, the church
interested itself in economic life, endeavoring to impose upon
economic dealings a minimum of legal honesty and churchly ethics.
 One of its most important measures was the support of the public
peace, which it attempted to enforce first on certain days and
finally as a general principle.  In addition, the great ecclesiastical
property communities, especially the monasteries, supported a
very rational economic life, which cannot be called capitalistic
economy but which was the most rational in existence.  Later these
endeavors more and more fell into discredit as the church revived
its old ascetic ideals and adapted them to the times.  Among the
emperors again are found a few beginnings of commercial policy
under Frederick Barbarossa, including price fixing and a customs
treaty with England designed to favor German merchants.  Frederick
II established the public peace but in general pursued a purely
fiscal policy favoring merely the rich merchants; to them he granted
privileges, especially customs exemptions. (345, 346) </P>

<P>The single measure of economic policy on the part of the German
kings was the conflict over the Rhine tolls, which however was
futile in the main, in view of the great number of petty lords
along the river.  Aside from this there was no planned economic
policy.  Measures which give the impression of such a policy,
such as the embargo of the emperor Sigmund against Venice, or
the occasional closing of the Rhine in the struggle with Cologne,
are purely political in character.  The customs policy was in
the hands of the territorial princes, and even here with few exceptions
a consistent effort to encourage industry is wanting.  Their dominant
objectives were, first, to favor local as against distaut trade,
especially to promote interchange of goods between the towns and
the surrounding country; export duties were always to be maintained
higher than import duties.  Second, to favor local merchants in
the customs.  Road tous were differentiated, the prince endeavoring
to favor his own roads in order the more conveniently to exploit
them as a source of revenue; to this end they even went to the
length of requiring the use of certain roads, and systematized
the law of the staple.  Finally, the city merchants were given
privileges; Louis the Rich of Bavaria prided himself on suppressing
the rural erchants (above, in p. 193). (346)</P>

<P>Protective duties are unknown, with few exceptions, of which
the Tirolese duties on wine, directed against the competition
of imports from Italy, are an example.  The customs policy as
a whole is dominated by the fiscal point of view and that of maintaining
the traditional standard of living.  The same applies to the customs
treaties, which go back to the 13th century.  The technique of
the customs fluctuated.  The original custom was an ad-valorem
duty of one-sixtieth the value; in the 14th century this was increased
to a one-twelfth, in view of the fact that the duty was made to
function also as an excise.  The place of our modern measures
of economic policy, such as protective tariffs, was taken by direct
prohibitions against trade, which were very frequently suspended
when the standard of living of domestic craftsmen, or later of
employing factors, was to be protected. <BR>
Sometimes wholesale trade was allowed and retail trade was prohibited.
 The first trace of a rational economic policy on the part of
the prince appears in the 14th century in England.  This was mercantilism,
so-called since Adam Smith. (346, 347)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(C) MERCANTILISM</P>

<P>The essence of mercantilism consists in carrying the point
of view of capitalistic industry into politics; the state is handled
as if it consisted exclusively of capitalistic entrepreneurs.
 External economic policy rests on the principle of taking every
advantage of the opponent, importing at the lowest price and selling
much higher.  The purpose is to strengthen the hand of the government
in its external relations.  Hence mercantilism signifies the development
of the state as a political power, which is to be done directly
by increasing the tax paying power of the population. (347)</P>

<P>A presupposition of the mercantilistic policy was the inclusion
of as many sources of money income as possible within the country
in question.  It is, to be sure, an error to hold that the mercantilistic
thinkers and statesmen confused ownership of the precious metals
with national wealth.  They knew well enough that the source of
this wealth is the tax paying power, and all that they did in
the way of retaining in the country the money which threatened
to disappear through the commerce was done exclusively with a
view to increasing this taxable capacity. A second point in the
program of mercantilism, in obvious immediate connection with
the power-seeking policy characteristic of the system, was to
promote the largest possible increase in the population; in order
to sustain the increased numbers, the endeavor was to secure to
the greatest extent external markets; this applied especially
to those products in which a maximum quantity of domestic labor
was embodied, hence finished manufactures rather than raw materials.
 Finally, trade was to be carried on as far as possible by the
merchants of the country, in order that its earnings should all
accrue to the taxable capacity.  On the side of theory, the system
was supported by the doctrine of the balance of trade, which taught
that the country would be impoverished if the value of imports
exceeded that of exports; this theory was first developed in England
in the 16th century. (347, 348)</P>

<P>England is distinctively the original home of Mercantilism.
 The first traces of the application of mercantilistic principles
are found there in the year 1381.  Under the weak king Richard
II, a money stringency arose and Parliament appointed an investigating
commission which for the first time dealt with the balance of
trade concept in all its essential features.  For the time being
it produced only emergency measures, including prohibitions of
importation and stimulation of exportation, but without giving
to English policy a truly mercantilistic character.  The real
turning point is generally dated from 1440. At that time, in one
of the numerous Statutes of Employment, which were passed for
the correction of alleged abuses, two propositions were laid down
which indeed had been applied before, but only in an incidental
way.  The first was that foreign merchants who brought goods to
England must convert all the money which they received into English
goods; the second that English merchants who had dealings abroad
must bring back to England at least a part of their proceeds in
cash.  On the basis of these two propositions developed gradually
the whole system of mercantilism down to the Navigation Act of
1651, with its elimination of the foreign shipping. (348, 349)
</P>

<P>Mercantilism in the sense of a league between the state and
the capitalistic interest had appeared under two aspects.  One
was that of class monopoly, which appears in its typical form
in the policy of the Stuarts and the Anglican church,- especially
that of Bishop Laud who was later beheaded.  This system looked
toward a class organization of the whole population in the Christian
socialist sense, a stabilization of the classes with a view to
establishing social relations based on Christian love.  In the
sharpest contrast with Puritanism, which saw every poor person
as work-shy or as a criminal, its attitude toward the poor was
friendly.  In practice, the mercantilism of the Stuarts was primarily
oriented along fiscal lines; new industries were allowed to import
only on the basis of a royal monopoly concession and were to be
kept under the permanent control of the king with a view to fiscal
exploitation.  Similar, although not so consistent, was the policy
of Colbert in France.  He aimed at an artificial promotion of
industries, supported by monopolies; this view he shared with
the Huguenots, on whose persecution he looked with disfavor. 
In England the royal and Anglican policy was broken down by the
Puritans under the Long Parliament.  Their struggle with the king
was pursued for decades under the war cry &quot;down with the
monopolies&quot; which were granted in part to foreigners and
in part to courtiers, while the colonies were placed in the hands
of royal favorites.  The small entrepreneur class which in the
meantime had grown up, especially within the guilds though in
part outside of them, enlisted against the royal monopoly policy,
and the Long Parliament deprived monopolists of the suffrage.
 The extraordinary obstinacy with which the economic spirit of
the English people has striven against trusts and monopolies is
expressed in these Puritan struggles.(349, 350)</P>

<P>The second form of mercantilism may be called national; it
limited itself to the protection of industries actually in existence,
in contrast with the attempt to establish industries through monopolies.
 Hardly one of the industries created by mercantilism survived
the mercantilistic period; the economic creations of the Stuarts
disappeared along with those of the western continental states
and those of Russia later.  It follows that the capitalistic development
was not an outgrowth of national mercantilism-, rather capitalism
developed at first in England alongside the fiscal monopoly policy.
 The course of events was that a stratum of entrepreneurs which
had developed in independence of the political administration
secured the systematic support of Parliament in the 18th century,
after the collapse of the fiscal monopoly policy of the Stuarts.
 Here for the last time irrational and rational capitalism faced
each other in conflict, that is, capitalism in the field of fiscal
and colonial privileges and public monopolies, and capitalism
oriented in relation to market opportunities which were developed
from within by business interests themselves on the basis of saleable
services. (350)</P>

<P>The point of collision of the two types was at the Bank of
England.  The bank was founded by Paterson, a Scotchman, a capitalist'
adventurer of the type called forth by the Stuarts' policy of
granting monopolies.  But Puritan business men also belonged to
the bank.  The last time the bank turned aside in the direction
of speculative capitalism was in connection with the South Sea
Company. Aside from this venture we can trace step by step the
process by which the influence of Paterson and his kind lost ground
in favor of the rationalistic type of bank members who were all
directly or indirectly of Puritan origin or influenced by Puritanism.
(350, 351)</P>

<P>Mercantilism also played the role familiar in economic history.
 In England it finally disappeared when free trade was established,
an achievement of the Puritan dissenters Cobden and Bright and
their league with the industrial interests, which were now in
a position to dispense with mercantilistic support. (351)<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->
