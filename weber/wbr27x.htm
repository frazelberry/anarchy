<P><FONT SIZE="+1">THE ORIGIN OF THE EUROPEAN GUILDS</FONT></P>

<P>In the large household of the feudal lords and princes as we
have seen, the <I>artificia</I> existed alongside the <I>official</I>
providing for the economic and political needs. Did the guilds
develop out of these organizations on the landed estates as the
so-called manorial law theory had affirmed? This theory started
from the assertion that as a demonstrable fact the manor included
workers for its own needs, a seigniorial organization which was
an integral part of the system of manorial law. The era of money
economy begins in the granting of market concessions. The landed
proprietors find it to their advantage to have markets on their
land because they can collect duties from the merchants. Thus
arises a market opportunity for the craftsman, who previously
provided only the compulsory contribution to the needs of the
lord. The next stage in the development is the town. It was regularly
founded on the basis of an imperial grant to a prince or lord
who used it to employ as a source of rent the craftsmen bound
to him by the manorial law. On this account, the theory contends,
he forced the guild organization upon the craftsman in view of
his political designs of a military character or for his household
purposes. Hence the guilds are originally official organizations
of the lord of the town (magis<I>teria). </I>Now begins the third
stage, the epoch of guild fusion. The craftsmen associated in
this manorial law organization combine and become economically
independent after they have gotten money in their hands through
production for the market. Then begins the struggle for the market
and for autonomy, in which the guilds are increasingly successful,
and the lord is finally expropriated as a result of the introduction
of money economy. (144, 145)</P>

<P>On the whole this theory is untenable. It does not take sufficient
account of the fact that the lord of the town, - that is, the
judicial lord - is a different functionary from the lord of the
land and that the founding of the town is regularly connected
in some way with the transfer of the judicial authority to the
person to whom the town privilege is granted. The judicial lord
is in a position, by virtue of his power as public judge, to lay
upon those within his jurisdiction burdens similar to those which
the lord of the land or personal liege lord laid upon his dependents.
The judicial lord is indeed subject to certain limitations, in
so far as he must strive to attract settlers by making the burdens
as light as possible. In consequence of the judicial power we
frequently find its holder in possession of compulsory services
of dependents, such as were formerly met with only in connection
with the personal liege lord. Heriot and the share of the lord
in inheritance are thus not always a sure indication of personal
bondage; the town lords also took such acknowledgments from persons
free from bondage or compulsory land services. Consequently the
craftsmen who were subject to such burdens do not necessarily
have to trace their development back to the personal suzerainty
of the judicial lords in question. (145)</P>

<P>Still less positively valid is the assumption that the guild
regularly developed out of manorial law. As a matter of fact we
may find in one and the same town both separate manors and a tendency
toward an exclusive unity which later develops into a guild. There
is no possibility of asserting that the customary law of one of
the manors was the basis of this unity. Often the territorial
lords even strove to prevent their dependent craftsmen belonging
to the artificia from joining the guilds. For it is not demonstrable
that the associations which we find previous to the appearance
of the guilds - the <I>fraternitates, </I>for example developed
into guilds. The <I>fraternitates </I>were religious societies,
while the guilds were secular in origin. It is true that we know
numerous instances in which religious associations later became
the germs of those of a profane character, but it can be shown
that the guilds were originally non-religious and laid claims
to religious functions only in the later middle ages, especially
after the appearance of the Corpus-Christi Day processions. Finally,
the manorial law theory overestimates the power of the territorial
lords in general. Where their authority was not combined with
the judicial authority, it was relatively small. (145, 146)</P>

<P>The actual contributions of territorial dominion in the development
of industry and the origin of the guilds lie in another field
than that assumed by the manorial law theory. In connection with
the market concession and the ancient tradition of skilled craftsmen
separated from household and clan, it contributed to the production
of the individual skilled artisan outside of household and clan
groupings. Thus it is one of the elements which obstructed in
the west the development toward household, clan, and tribal industry,
such as took place in China and India. The result was achieved
through the fact that the culture of antiquity moved inland from
the coast. Inland towns arose which became the seats of craft
groups locally specialized and producing for a local market, exchange
between ethnic groups being displaced. The oikos-economy developed
trained craftsmen; as a result of the fact that these began to
produce for the market, the workers subject to head dues streamed
into the towns and developed production for the market as a type.
The guilds promoted this tendency and helped it to become dominant.
Where the guilds were not victorious or did not originate at all,
house industry and tribal industry persisted, as in the case of
Russia. (146, 147)</P>

<P>The question whether the free or unfree craftsman is prior
in the west cannot be answered in general terms. It is certain
that the unfree are mentioned in the records earlier than the
free. Moreover, to begin with, only a few sorts of craftsmen existed;
in the <I>Lex Salica </I>only the faber occurs, who may be a smith
or a wood worker or any other sort of artisan. In southern Europe
free craftsmen are mentioned as early as the sixth century, in
the north in the eighth, and from the Carolingian period they
became more common. (147)</P>

<P>But in contrast, the guilds first appear in the towns. To picture
their origin clearly we must visualize the fact that the population
of the medieval town was of mixed composition and that its privileges
were not only for that class which was of free extraction. The
majority of the inhabitants were unfree. On the other hand, compulsory
services rendered to the town lord showing similarity to territorial
or personal overlordship do not prove servility. In any Case it
is certain that a considerable fraction of the town craftsmen,
perhaps a majority, did come from the unfree classes, and that
only those who produced products for the market, and as price
workers marketed them, were admitted to the status of mercator
- a work technically equivalent to citizen (burgher). It is certain
also that the mass of the craftsmen stood originally in a relation
of wardship (<I>Muntmannentum</I>), and finally that the craftsman
in so far and for so long as he remained unfree was subject to
the judicial power of the lord, although only in matters requiring
the consent of the baronial court. Hence, he was thus subject
only in so far and for so long as he still possessed a land holding
within a manor and was obligated to feudal land services; affairs
of the market did not come before the baronial court but belonged
to the jurisdiction of the mayor or the municipal court, to which
the craftsman again was subject not because he was free or unfree
but insofar as he was Mercator and as such had a share in the
affairs of the town. (147, 148)</P>

<P>In Italy, the guilds seem to have existed continuously from
late Roman times. In contrast, no guild is to be thought of in
the north whose laws did not rest on a grant from a judicial lord,
for only he was in a position to exercise the compulsion necessary
for maintaining guild life. Apparently, private associations of
various sorts preceded the guilds; and in fact we know no more
about the matter of origins. (148)</P>

<P>Originally, the town lords reserved certain rights as against
the guilds; especially, since they demanded certain services of
a military and economic character as taxes from the guilds for
the purposes of the town, they insisted on naming the head of
the guild, and on grounds of subsistence policy and of police
and military considerations they often carried control deep into
the guilds' economic affairs. All these prerogatives of the town
lords were later acquired by the guilds, either by way of revolution
or for compensation through buying out the possessor. In general
they were engaged in a struggle from the beginning. They contended
first for the right to choose their own leaders and make their
own laws; otherwise they would not have been in a position to
carry out their monopolistic policies. In regard to compulsory
membership in the guild they usually secured their end without
difficulty, because it was in the interest of the town lord himself.
They also struggled to free themselves from the burdens laid upon
them,-compulsory services, due to town lord or town council, quit-rents
both personal and connected with land, general taxes, and rents
demanded of them. Often the contest ended in the guild converting
the burden into a fixed money payment, the obligation of which
it assumed as a group. As early as 1099 the struggle of the weavers
of Mayence for freedom from the feudal dues were decided in their
favor. Finally, the guilds struggled against wardship (Muntmannentum),
especially the representation of the ward before the court by
the patron, and in general for political equality with the upper
class families. (148, 149)</P>

<P>After victory was won in these struggles the specific subsistence
policy of the guilds begins with the tendency to establish the
guild monopoly. Opposed to it were in the first place the consumers.
They were unorganized, as today and always, but the town or the
prince might become their champion. Both of these set up a vigorous
resistance to the guild monopoly. In the interest of a better
provision for the consumers the town often retained the right
to name free masters without regard to the decision of the guild.
Furthermore, the towns subjected the food industries to an extensive
control through the establishment of municipal slaughter houses,
meat markets, mills, and ovens, often imposing upon the craftsmen
themselves the obligation to make use of these institutions. This
regulation was the more easily put through since the guilds in
their early days operated entirely without fixed capital. Moreover,
the town struggled for power over the guild through the agency
of price fixing, setting maximum wages or prices in opposition
to the minimum wages and prices of the guilds. (149)</P>

<P>Furthermore, the guild had competition to contend against.
Under this head are included the craft workers of the landed estates,
especially those of the monasteries, in the country and also in
the towns themselves. In contrast with the lay lords, who were
hindered by military considerations, the monasteries, thanks to
their rational economic procedure, were in a position to set up
the most varied industrial establishments and to accumulate considerable
wealth. In so far as they produced for the market, they furnished
notable competition for the guilds and were fought bitterly by
the latter. Even in the Reformation period, the competition of
monastic industrial work was one of the considerations which drove
the burgher element to the side of Luther. In addition, the struggle
was directed against the craftsmen in the country at large, both
the free and the unfree, the settled and the itinerant workers.
In this struggle the merchants regularly stood side by side with
the rural craftsmen against the guilds. None the less the result
was an extensive destruction of house industry and tribal industry.
(150)</P>

<P>A third struggle of the guilds was directed against the laborers,
against those who were not yet masters, which set in as soon as
the guild undertook limitation of numbers in any form or the closing
of the guild or the raising of difficulties in the way of entry
into mastership. In this connection are mentioned the prohibition
against working on one's own account instead of that of a master,
the prohibition against working in one's own dwelling-because
the journeyman could not be controlled or subjected to house discipline-and
finally the prohibition against marriage by the journeyman before
he became a master; this prohibition could not be enforced and
a married journeyman class became the rule. (150)</P>

<P>The guilds struggled with the merchants, especially the retailers,
who met the needs of the town market and would draw their products
from wherever they could obtain them most cheaply. Retail trade
involved little risk in comparison with trade with remote regions
and allowed a more secure profit. The retailers, of whom the merchant
tailors formed a typical stratum, were the friends of the rural
craftsmen and enemies of those of the town, and the struggles
between them and the guilds are among the most intense known to
the middle ages. (150, 151)</P>

<P>Parallel with the struggle against the retailers went wars
within individual guilds and between various guilds. These arose
first in cases where workers possessed of capital and others without
it were present in the same guild, which presented an opportunity
for the propertyless to become home workers for the wealthy members.
A similar situation existed as between wealthy guilds and others
possessing little capital, within the same production proem. These
struggles led in Germany, Flanders, and Italy to sanguinary guild
revolutions, while in France only one guild outbreak occurred
and in England the transition to the capitalistic domestic system
was completed practically without revolutionary acts of violence.
The field of such struggles is to be sought in situations where
the process of production was divided transversely rather than
on the basis of products. This was especially the case in the
textile industry, where the weavers, walkers, dyers, tailors,
etc. existed side by side, and the question arose as to which
of these different units or stages in the single production process
would force the others to leave it in control of the market, renounce
to it the chance of large profits and become home workers on account
of its members. The walkers were often victors, forcing the other
divisions of the industry to be content with allowing them to
purchase the raw materials and prepare them and market the finished
product. In other cases it was the finishers, or weavers,and in
London the tailors, who forced the previous stages of the process
into their employ. In England the result was that wealthy masters
in the guilds came no longer to have anything to do with craft
work. The struggle often ended in a compromise, to be resumed
later and go on to the winning of the market by one of the produetion
stages. The course of events in Solingen is typical. The smiths,
sword furbishers, and polishers, after a long struggle, concluded
a treaty in 1487, according to which all three of the guilds were
to retain free access to the market. Finally, however, the guild
of furbishers obtained control. Most frequently the final stage
of production secured the market as a result of the conflict,
because knowledge of demand was most easily obtained from that
vantage point. This was regularly the case where a certain end
product enjoyed an especially favorable market. Thus in wartime
the saddlers had an excellent opportunity for bringing the leather
dressers under their power. Or, the stage which possessed the
most capital might be victorious, those who employed the most
valuable productive equipment succeeding in the effort to force
the others into their service. (151, 152)
