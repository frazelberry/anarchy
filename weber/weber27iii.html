<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The small family may be the starting point of the development
of a com<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->munistic household, but
it may also evolve into the large-scale manorial household. Viewed
in its economic relations, the latter is primarily the medium
of development of agricultural proprietorship and hence of Grundherrschaft,
the manor and feudalism.</P>

<P>The differentiation in wealth which lies at the base of this
development has different sources. One is chieftainship, whether
in the chieftain of a clan or of a military group. The division
of the land among the members of the in clan was in the hands
of the clan chieftan. This traditional right often developed into
seigniorial power which became hereditary. The respect which a
clan owed to such hereditary distinction was expressed in gifts
and aids in connection with tillage and house building, request
services to begin with, but developing into obligations. The leader
in war might win the title to land through internal differentiation
or through conquest outside the clan. Every where he has a privileged
claim in the distribution of booty and in the division of conquered
land. His followers also demanded privileged treatment in the
allotment of land. This seigniorial land did not ordinarily share
in the burdens of the normal field divisions - as, for example,
in the ancient German economic system - but on the contrary was
cultivated with the aid of the occupiers of the ordinary holdings.
(51)</P>

<P>Internal differentiation developed through the appearance of
a professional military class, which resulted from the progress
of military technique and improvement in the quality of military
equipment. Neither the training nor the equipment were available
for men in a dependent economic position. Thus arose a distinction
between those classes which by virtue of their possessions were
in a position to render military service and to equip themselves
for the same, and those who could not do this and consequently
were not able to maintain the full status of free men. The development
of agricultural technique worked in the same direction as military
progress. The result was that the ordinary peasant was increasingly
bound to his economic functions. Further differentiation came
about through the fact that the upper classes, skilled in fighting,
and providing their own equipment, accumulated booty in varying
degrees through thei military activity, while non-military men
who could not do this became more and more subject to various
services and taxes. These were either imposed by direct force
or resulted from the purchase of exemptions. (52)</P>

<P>The other course of internal differentiation is through the
conquest and subjugation of some enemy people. Originally, conquered
enemies are slaughtered, under some circumstances with cannibalistic
orgies. Only as a secondary matter develops the practice of exploiting
their labor power and transforming them into a servile class of
burden bearers. Thus arises a class of overlords who by their
possession of human beings are placed in a position to clear and
till land, a thing impossible to the common free man. The slave
or servile population might be exploited communally, remaining
in the possession of the group as a whole, and used for collective
tillage of the soil, as was partly the case with the helots of
Sparta; or, they might be utilized individually, being alloted
to individual overlords for the tillage of their personal land
holdings. This latter development establishes a nobility of conquest.
(52, 53)</P>

<P>In addition to conquest and to internal differentiation must
be recognized voluntary submission of the defenseless man to the
overlordship of a military leader. Because the former needed protection
he recognized a lord as patronus (in Rome) or as senior, among
the Merovingian Franks. Thus he established a claim to representation
before the court, as in the Frankish empire, to a champion in
the trial by battle, or to the testimony of the lord instead of
the compurgation of the clansmen. In return he furnished services
or payments, the significance of which is not, however, the exploitation
of the dependent. He can be called upon only for service worhty
of a free man, especially for military service. In the last days
of the Roman Republic, for example, various senatorial families
in this way called out hundreds of their clients and colons against
Caesar.</P>

<P>The fourth mode of origin of seigniorial proprietorship is
through land settlement under feudal terms. The chieftain with
large possessions in human beings and work animals is in a position
to reclaim land on a quite different scale from the ordinary peasant.
But cleared land belonged in principle to him who brought it under
tillage, as long as he was able to cultivate it. Thus the differential
command over human labor power, where it appeared, worked indirectly
as well as directly in the field of winning land for a seignioral
class. An example of such exploitation of a superior economic
position is the patricians&#146; exercise of the right of occupancy
on the Roman ager publicus. (53)</P>

<P>The seignioral land, after it was broken up, was regularly
utilitzed by the method of leasing. Leases were granted to foreigners,
- for example to craftsmen, who then stood under the general protection
of the king or chieftan - or to impoverished persons. Where the
latter are concerned we find, especially among nomadic peoples,
the leasing of cattle also; otherwise in general the placing of
settlers upon baronial land under obligation to make payments
and render services. This is the so-called colonate, met with
all over the East, in Italy, in Gaul, and also among the Germans.
Money fiefs and grain fiefs, essentially loans, are also frequently
a means to the accumulation of serfs and of land. Alongside the
colons and slaves, the peons or nexi play a large role, especially
in the economic life of antiquity. (53, 54)</P>

<P>Frequently there was an intermixing of those forms of dependency
which grew out of clan relations with those deriving from seigniorial
power. For landless men in the protection of an overlord, or for
foreigners, membership in a clan was no longer in question and
the distinctions between clan members, mark members, and members
of the tribes disappear in the single category of feudal dependents.
A further source in the development of seignorial claims is the
profession of magic. In many cases the chieftain developed, not
out of a military leader, but out of a rainmaker. The medicine
man could lay a curse on certain objects, which then became protected
by &quot;taboo&quot; against all molestation. The aristocracy
of magic thus acquired priestly property, and where the prince
allied himself with the priest he employed the taboo to secure
his personal possessions; this is especially common in the South
Sea Islands. (54)</P>

<P>A sixth possibility for the development of seigniorial property
is afforded by trade. Regulation of trade with other communities
originally lies entirely in the hands of the chieftain, who at
first is required to use it in the interests of the tribe. He
makes it a source of income for himself by levying duties which,
to begin with, are only a payment for the protection he grants
to foreign merchants, since he grants market concessions and protects
market dealings - for a consideration always, as need not be said.
Later the chieftain often goes on to trade on his own account,
establishing a monopoly by excluding the membership of the community
- village, tribe or clan. Thus he obtains the means of making
loans, which are the means of reducing his own tribesmen to peonage,
and of accumulating land. (54, 55)</P>

<P>Trade may be carried on by such chieftains according to two
methods: either by regulation of trade, and hence its monopolization,
remains in the hands of the inidividual chieftain, or a group
of chieftains unite to form a trading settlement. This case gives
rise to a town, with a patriciate of traders, that is, a privileged
stratum whose position rests upon the accumulation of property
through trading profits. The first is the rule among many negro
tribes as on the coast of Kamerun. In Ancient Egypt, monopolization
of trade was typically in the hands of the Pharaohs, resting in
large part on their personal trade monopolies. We find similar
conditions among the kings of Cyrenaica, and later, in part, in
medieval feudalism. (55)</P>

<P>The second form of chieftain trade, the development of a town
nobility, is typical for antiquity and the early middle ages.
In Genoa, and in Venice on the Rialto, the noble families settled
together are the only full citizens. They finance the merchants,
without themselves taking part in trade, through various forms
of credit. The result is indebtedness of the other population
groups, especially the peasants, to the municipal patriciate.
In this way arose the patrician landed proprietorship of antiquity,
alongside that of military princes. Thus the ancient nations are
characterized as an assemblage of coast-wise towns with a nobility
of large land owners interested in trade. The culture of antiquity
retained a coastal character down into the Greek period. No town
of this older period lies farther than a day's journey inland.
In the country, by contrast, were the seats of the baronial chieftains
with their tenants.</P>

<P>Seigniorial property may also have fiscal roots, in the organization
of taxation and the officialdom of the state, and under this caption
there are two possibilities. Either their arose a centralized
personal enterprise of the prince with separation of the administrative
officials from the resources with which they worked, so that political
power belonged to no one except to the prince, or else there was
a class organization of the administration with the enterprises
of vassals, tax farmers and officials, functioning in a subsidiary
role alongside that of the prince. In the latter case, the prince
granted the land to the subordinates who paid all the costs of
administration out of their own pockets. According to the dominance
of one or the other of these systems, the political and social
constitution of the state would be entirely different. Economic
considerations largely determine which form would win out. The
east and the west show in this regard the usual contrast. For
oriental economy - China, Asia Minor, Egypt - irrigation husbandry
became dominant, while in the west where settlements resulted
from the clearing of land, forestry sets the type. (56)</P>

<P>The irrigation culture of the Orient developed directly out
of primitive hoe-culture, without the use of animals. Alongside
it developed a garden culture with irrigation from the large rivers,
the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia, and the Nile in Egypt.
Irrigation and its regulation presupposed a systematic and organized
husbandry out of which the large scale royal enterprise of the
near east developed as is shown most characteristically in the
New Empire of Thebes. The military campaigns of the Assyrian and
Babylonian kings, which they undertook with their masses of retainers
going back to the men's house system, were primarily man hunts
for the purpose of securing the human material for building canals
and bringing stretches of the desert under tillage. (56, 57)</P>

<P>The king retained control of water regulations, but required
for its exercise an organized bureaucracy. The agricultural and
irrigation bureaucracies of Egypt and Mesopotamia, the foundation
of which is thus economic, are the oldest officialdom in the world;
it remains throughout its history an adjunct of the king's personal
economic enterprise. The individual officials were slaves, or
dependents of the king, or even soldiers, and were often branded
to prevent escape. The tax administration of the king was based
on payments in kind, which in Egypt were stored up in warehouses
from which the king supported his officials and laborers. Such
a provision is the oldest form of official salary.</P>

<P>The result of the system as a whole was to place the population
in a servile relation to the prince. This relation found expression
in the obligatory services of all the dependents and the joint
liability of the village for the burdens imposed, and finally
in the principle designated under the Ptolemies as (greek). Under
it the individual peasant was not only bound to the soil but to
his village as well, and was in fact an outlaw if he could not
prove his (more greek). The system obtains not only in Egypt but
in Mesopotamia as well and also in Japan, where from the seventh
to the tenth centuries we find the ku-bun-den system. In the one
case as in the other, the position of the peasant corresponds
throughout to that of the member of the Russian mir. (57)</P>

<P>Out of the obligatory services of the subject population arose
gradually the money economy centering in the prince. This development
also might take various courses. One was through an individual
economy with production and trade carried on by the prince; or,
the prince made use of the labor power politically subject to
him to produce goods not only for his own use but also for the
market, as was the case in Egypt and Babylonia. Trade and production
for the market would be carried on auxiliary to a large household,
with no separation between household and industrial establishment.
This is the type of economic organization which Rodbertus has
designated as &quot;oikos-economy.&quot;</P>

<P>This oikos-economy would again be the initial stage in various
lines of development. One of these is the Egyptian system of grain
banks. The Pharaoh possessed grain warehouses scattered over the
land, to which the peasant delivered up not only his obligatory
payments in kind but his whole production; against these the king
could draw checks which he could put into use as money. Another
possibility was the development of royal taxation in money, which
however, presupposes a considerable permeation of the use of money
into private economic relations, as well as a considerable development
of production and a general market within the country; all these
conditions were fulfilled in Ptolemaic Egypt. The system encountered
difficulties, in view of the then state of development of administrative
technique, in the preparation of a budget. Consequently, the ruler
generally shifted the risk of the computation on to other shoulders,
by one of three methods. Either he farmed out the collection of
taxes to adventurers or officials, or he delegated it directly
to soldiers, who paid themselves out of the receipts, or finally,
he gave over the task to landed proprietors. The placing of the
tax collection in private hands was a consequence of the lack
of a dependable administrative machine, which again goes back
to moral unreliability in the official personnel. (58, 59)</P>

<P>The practise of farming out taxes to adventurers also developed
on the largest scale in India. Every such zamindar has a tendency
to develop into a landed proprietor. The recruiting of soldiers
is also given over to contractors called jagirdar, who have to
provide a certain quota irrespective of the elements of which
it is composed; these also strive to become large landholders.
Such proprietors are akin to the feudal baron living in full independence
upward and downward, in a position analogous to that of Wallenstein,
who also had to furnish recruits. When the ruler turns taxation
over to officials, he fixes by agreement a definite sum; any surplus
belongs to the official, who also has to pay the administrative
staff. This is the system of the earlier mandarin administration
in China, as well as of the satrap organization of the ancient
east. With the transition to modern taxation policies, the Chinese
statistics showed a sudden surprising increase in the population,
which the mandarins had purposely understated. The third possibility
under the head of a money economy centered in the prince, is the
delegation of taxation to soldiers. This is a recourse of state
bankruptcy and is done when the prince is unable to pay the soldiers.
Resort to this device accounts for the transformation in the affairs
of the Caliphate under the dominance of Turkish soldiers from
the tenth century on. The soldiers develop into a military nobility
because the central government no longer has, in fact, control
over taxation, and extricates itself by turning the function over
to the army. (59)</P>

<P>These three forms of individualization of the originally political
functions of securing money and recruits - centering them in private
contractors, officials, or soldiers - became the basis of the
oriental feudalism which developed upon the disintegration of
the money economy in consequence of the technical incompetence
of the state to administer taxation through its own officials.
The result is a secondary, rationalized agrarian communism, with
joint responsibility of the peasant communities to the tax farmer,
official, or army, and with common tillage and attachment to the
soil. The contrast with the western system comes out clearly in
the fact that in the east no demesne economy (Fronhofwirtschaft)
arose, the exaction of forced payments dominating. A further feature
is the liability of collapse into a barter economy on the appearance
of the least difficulty in transforming the payments in kind of
the peasants into money. In such an event an oriental political
system falls back with extraordinary facility from the condition
of an apparently highly developed culture into one of primitive
barter economy. (59, 60)</P>

<P>As a fourth and last method of realizing a royal income, we
find the delegation of functions to chieftains or landed proprietors.
Thus the prince avoids the problem of an administrative organization.
He shifts the raising of the taxes, and on occasion also that
of recruits, upon already existent agencies of a private character.
This is what happened in Rome when in the imperial period the
civilization extended inland from the sea-coast and the country
became transformed from a union of primarily maritime towns into
a territorial empire. The inland knew only manorial economy without
the use of money. The functions of raising taxes and recruits
were now imposed upon it, whereupon the large landed proprietors,
the possessores, become the dominant class down to the time of
Justinian. The dependent population over which they rule enables
them to furnish the taxes, while the imperial administrative system
has not expanded in keeping with the growth of the empire itself.
On the side of administrative technique, this situation is distinguish
at the municipia appear the territoria, at the head of which stand
the landed barons, responsible to the state for taxes and recuits.
Out of this condition developed the colonate in the west, while
in the east the latter is as old as the (greek). Under Diocletian
this fundamental principle was extended to the empire as a whole.
Every person was included in a territorial taxation unit which
he was not permitted to leave. The head of such a district is
generally a territorial lord, as the center of gravity of the
economic and political life has shifted from the sea-coast to
the land.</P>

<P>A special case of this development is the appearance of colonial
proprietorship. Originally the interest in the winning of colonies
is purely fiscal in character, - colonial capitalism. The objective,
pecuniary exploitation, was achieved through the conquerer making
the subject natives responsible for taxes in the form of money
or the delivery of products, especially food stuffs and spices.
The state generally transferred the exploitation of the colonies
to a commercial company,- for example, the British and Dutch East
India companies. Since the native chieftains are made the intermediaries
of the joint liability they are transformed into territorial lords,
and the originally free peasantry into their serfs or dependents
bound to the land. Attachment to the soil with feudal obligations
and communal tillage, with the right and duty of redistributing
the land, all appear. Another form of the development of colonial
proprietorship is the individual allotment of land by an overlord.
The type of this is the encomienda in Spanish South America. The
encomienda was a feudal grant with the right of imposing on the
Indians compulsory services, payments, or labor dues, and in this
form it persisted to the beginning of the 19th century. (61)</P>

<P>In contrast with the oriental system of individualizing political
prerogatives on fiscal grounds and in relation to a money economy,
stands the product economy of the western feudal system and that
of Japan, with the development of feudal proprietorship through
enfeoffment. The ordinary purpose of the feudal system is the
provision of a mounted soldiery through the granting of land and
seigniorial rights to persons who are in a position to take over
the services of vassals. It is met with in two f orms, according
as the proprietory power is granted as a fief or as a benefice.</P>

<P>For enfeoffment with benefice the organization of Turkish feudalism
is characteristic. There was no recognition of a permanent individual
proprietorship but only grants for life and in consideration of
service in war. The grant was evaluated according to its yield,
and proportioned to the rank of the family and to the military
service of the recipient. As it was not hereditary, the son of
the grantee succeeded only in case he could show specific military
services. The Sublime Porte regulated all details as a sort of
supreme feudal bureau, after the manner of the Frankish major
domo.</P>

<P>This system is akin to that which originally obtained in Japan.
After the 10th century Japan went over from the ku-bun-den system
to one based on the benefice principle. The Shogun, a vassal and
commander-in-chief of the emperor, with the aid of his bureau
(ba-ku-fu) evaluated the land according to its yield in rice and
granted it in benefices to his vassals the daimios, who in turn
re-granted it to their ministerials, the samurai. Later, the inheritance
of fiefs became established. However, the original dependence
upon the Shogun persisted in the form of the latter's control
over the administration of the daimios, who in turn supervised
the operations of their vassals.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The Russian feudal system is nearer to the European. In Russia,
f:iefs (pomjestje) were granted on consideration of certain obligatory
services to the czar and the assumption of tax obligations. The
recipients of grants had to assume the position of military officers
and civil officials, a specification which was first set aside
by Catherine II. The transformation of the tax administration
from the land to the poll basis under Peter the Great led to the
result that the land holder became answerable for taxes in proportion
to the number of souls on his holding, determined through periodical
surveys. The results of this system for the agricultural organization
as a whole have already been described (pp. 17 ff.).</P>

<P>Next to Japan, the medieval occident is the region which developed
feudalism in the highest purity. Conditions in the later Roman
empire operated as a preparation, especially as to land tenure,
which already had, a half feudal character. The land rights of
the Germanic chieftains fused into the Roman situation. The extent
and significance of land holding was extraordinarily increased
through the clearing and conquest of land - the victorious armies
had to be fitted out with land - and finally through commendation
on a large scale. The peasant who found himself without property,
or who was no longer in a position to equip himself for military
service, was compelled by the advance of military technique to
place himself in the obsequium of an economically more powerful
person. A further influence was the extensive transfers of land
to the church. The decisive condition, however, was the invasion
of the Arabs and the necessity of opposing an army of Frankish
horsemen to that of Islam. Charles Martel undertook an extensive
secularization of church property with a view to establishing,
with the benefices created out of the seized tracts, a tremendous
army of vassal knights, the members of which had to equip themselves
as heavily armed horsemen. Finally, besides the land, it became
the custom to grant as fiefs political offices and privileges.
