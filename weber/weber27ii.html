<P>(A) FORMS OF APPROPRIATION.</P>

<P>The forms of appropriation are quite as diverse as the forms
of husbandry. The proprietorship everywhere vests originally in
the house community; but this may be either the individual family,
the zadruga of the South Slavs, or a still larger association,
as for example that of the Iroquois long-house. Appropriation
may be carried out on two different bases. Either the physical
means of labor, especially the soil, are treated as implements,
in which case they frequently appertain to the woman and her kindred;
or, the land is treated as &quot;spear land,&quot; territory which
has been conquered and is protected by the man; in this case it
belongs to an agnatic clan or some other masculine group. In any
case purely economic considerations do not uniquely determine
the form of primitive appropriation and division of labor, but
military, religious, and magical motives also enter.</P>

<P>In the past the individual had to adjust himself to a plurality
of organizations to which he belonged. The following are the types:</P>

<P>1. The Household. Its structure is diverse but it was always
a consumption group. The physical means of pro&not; duction, especially
movable goods, might also pertain to the house group. In that
case appropriation might be carried farther within the group,
the weapons and masculine aecoutrements for example belonging
to the man, with special mode of inheritance, the articles of
adornment and feminine accoutrements to the woman.</P>

<P>2. The Clan. This also may hold goods in varying degrees of
proprietorship. It may own the land; in any case, the members
of the clan regularly keep as a remnant of originally widely extended
property rights certain claims against the possessions of the
house community, such as the requirement for its consent in case
of sale, or a prior option to purchase. Further, the clan is responsible
for the security of the individual. To it pertains the duty of
avenging, and of enforcing the law of vengeance. It also has a
right to share in head money, and a joint proprietorship over
the women belonging to the clan, hence, a share in bride purchase
money. The clan may be masculine or feminine in constitution.
If property and other rights pertain to a masculine clan we speak
of paternal succession or agnation, otherwise of maternal or conation.</P>

<P>3. Magic Groupings. The most important group is the totem clan
which arose at a time when certain beliefs in animinism and spiritual
entities were dominant.</P>

<P>4. The Village and Mark Association, essentially economic in
significance.</P>

<P>5. The Political Group. This organization protects the territory
occupied by the village and consequently possesses extensive authority
in connection with the settlement of the land. In addition it
requires of the individual military and court services, giving
him corresponding rights; it also enforces'lhe feudal services
and taxes.</P>

<P>The individual must also take into account under different
conditions the following:</P>

<P>6. Overlordship of land, when the soil which he tills is not
his own.</P>

<P>7. Personal Overlordship when the individual is not free but
is in bondage to another.</P>

<P>Every individual German peasant stood in the past in relation
to an overlord of land and person, and to a political sovereign,
one or more of whom had some claim to his services. Agricultural
development took various forms according as these different persons
were distinct or identical; in the former case, the rivalry of
the different overlords favored the freedom of the peasant, while
in the latter the trend was toward servility.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(B) THE HOUSE COMMUNITY AND THE CLAN</P>

<P>Today the house community or family household is commonly a
small-family, that is, a community of parents and children. It
is based on legitimate marriage presumed to be permanent. The
economic life of this small family is unitary in regard to consumption,
and at least nominally distinct from the productive organization.
Within the household all property right vests in the master of
the house as an individual, but is limited in various ways in
regard to the special belongings of the wife and children. Kinship
is reckoned alike on the paternal and maternal sides, its significance
being practically limited to the matter of inheritance. The concept
of the clan in the old sense no longer survives; only rudiments
of it can be recognized in the right of collateral inheritance,
and even here there is a question as to the age and the history
of these relations The socialistic theory proceeds from the assumption
of various evolutionary stages in the marriage institution. According
to this view the original condition was one of spontaneous sex
promiscuity within the horde (endogamy), corresponding to the
complete absence of private property. Proof of this assumption
is found in various alleged survivals of the original conditions:
in religious institutions of an orgiastic character among primitive
peoples, meat, alcohol, and narcotic orgies, in which the restraints
upon sexual relations disappear; in freedom of sexual relations
before marriage, for women as well as men, such as is found among
various peoples; in the sexual promiscuity of the hieroduli of
the ancient east who gave themselves indiscriminately to any man;
finally, in the institution of the levirate found among the Israelites
and in various places and involving the privilege and duty of
the clan brother to marry the widow of a deceased man and provide
him with heirs. In this arrangement is seen a remnant of primitive
endogamy which is supposed to have become gradually narrowed down
to a claim upon a particular individual.</P>

<P>The second evolutionary stage according to this socialistic
theory is group marriage. Definite groups (clan or tribe) form
a marriage unit in relation to other groups, any man of the one
being regarded as the husband of any woman of the other. The argument
rests on inference from the absence of terms for any kinship except
that of father and mother among Indian peoples; at a certain age
these terms are applied indiscriminately. Further evidence is
drawn from isolated cases of marriage groups in the South Pacific
Islands where a number of men possess simultaneous or successive
sexual rights over a particular woman, or conversely a number
of women over a particular man.</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor286971"></A>Socialistic theory considers the
&quot;mother right,&quot; (Muttorrecht) as a fundamental transition
stage. According to the theory, at a time when the causal connection
between the sexual act and birth was unknown, the house community
consisted not of families but of mother-groups; only the maternal
kinship had ritualistic or legal standing. This stage is inferred
from the widespread institution of the &quot;avunculate&quot;
in which her mother's brother is the woman's protector and her
children inherit from him. The matriarchate was also regarded
as a developmental stage. Under this arrangement, met with in
various communities, the distinction of chieftainship was fixed
exclusively in the woman, and she was the leader in economic affairs,
especially those of the household community. From this condition
it was supposed that the transition to father-right took place
through the institution of marriage by capture. Beyond a certain
stage, the ritualistic basis of promiscuity was condemned and
exogamy displaced endogamy as a general principle, that is, sexual
relations became restricted to persons in other groups, involving
commonly the obtaining of the woman from these groups by violence.
Out of this practice should have developed marriage by purchase.
An argument for this course of development is found in the fact
that even among many civilized peoples who have long since gone
over to contractual marriage the marriage ceremonies still symbolize
forcible abduction. Finally, the transition to patriarchal-law
(Vaterrecht, father-right) and legitimate monogamy is in socialistic
thinking connected with the origin of private property and the
endeavor of the man to secure legitimate heirs. Herein takes place
the great lapse into sin; from here on monogamous marriage and
prostitution go hand in hand.</P>

<P>So much for the theory of mother-right and the socialistic
doctrine based upon it. Although it is untenable in detail it
forms, taken as a whole, a valuable contribution to the solution
of the problem. Here again is the old truth exemplified that an
ingenious error is more fruitful for science than stupid accuracy.
A criticism of the theory leads to consideration first of the
evolution of prostitution, in which connection, it goes without
saying, no ethical evaluation is involved.</P>

<P>We understand by prostitution submission to sexual relations
for a price, in order to secure a money income, and a regular
profession. In this sense prostitution is not product of monogamy
and private property, but is of immemorial age. There is no historical
period and no stage of evolution in which it is not to be found.
It is unsual in Mohammedan civilization and is absent among few
primitive peoples, but the institution itself and establishment
for both homosexual and heterosexual prostitution are found among
the very peoples pointed out by socialistic theorists for the
absence of private property, and everywhere the profession is
segregated as a class and generally given an outcast position,
with prohibitions in the case of sacerdotal prostitution. Between
professional prostitution and the various forms of marriage intervene
all possible intermediate arrangements of or occasional sexual
relations, which are not necessarily condemned ethically or legally.
While today the contract providing for sexual pleasure outside
of marriage is void, turpi causa, in the Egypt of the Ptolemies
there was sexual freedom of contract with enforceable exchange
by the woman of sex gratification for sustenance, rights in estates,
or other considerations. Prostitution, however, not only appears
in the form of an unregulated sexual submission but is also met
with in the sacramentally regulated form of ritualistic prostitution,
for example, the hieroduli in India and the ancient east. These
were female slaves who had to function in the anple in connection
with the religious services, of which part consists in their sex
orgies. The hieroduli are also found submitting themselves to
the public for pay. The institution of the hieroduli goes back
to sacerdotal sources, to animistic magic of a sexual character,
which has a way of running into sexual promiscuity in view of
the progressive self-excitement of an ecstatic situation.</P>

<P>Copulation as a form of magic for stimulating fertility is
widespread among agricultural peoples. The sexual orgy was even
carried out on the ground itself with the expectation of increasing
its productivity. Out of participation in this sacramental process
arose in India the calling of the bayaderes which play an important
role in the cultural life of India as free hetaerae, similar to
the Greek women so designated. But in spite of the favorable conditions
of their lives they ranked as outcasts, and as is shown by the
Indian bayadere dramas, regarded it as the highest peak of good
fortune to be elevated through a miracle to the class of married
women living under very degraded conditions.</P>

<P>Besides the hieroduli there are found in Babylon and Jerusalem
the temple prostitutes proper, whose principal clients were the
traveling merchants. These kept to their occupation after its
loss of sacramental and orgiastic character, under the protection
of the material interests of the temple. The struggle against
officially legitimatized prostitution, and its source the orgy,
was carried on by the prophets and priests of the great religions
of salvation, Zarathustra, the Brahmans, and the Prophets of the
Old Testament. They carried on the fight partly on ethical and
rational grounds; it was the battle of those who wished to deepen
the inner life of man and saw in subjection to eroticism the greatest
obstacle to the triumph of the religious motive. In addition,
the rivalry of cults played a part. The God of ancient Israel
was a hill God, not a ... deity like Baal, and the police power
stood beside the priests in this struggle, as the state feared
the rise of revolutionary movements of the lower classes out of
the emotional excitement connected with orgiastic phenomena. Nevertheless,
prostitution as such survived after the discontinuance of the
orgy, which was under suspicion of the state; but it was outlawed
and illicit. In the middle ages, in spite of the church doctrine,
it had official recognition and was organized as a guild. In Japan
also the occasional use of the tea-house girls as prostitutes
continued down to the present and not merely has not caused them
to lose caste, but has made them especially desired in marriage.</P>

<P>The reversal in the status of prostitution did not begin till
the end of the 15th century, when it followed the serious outbreak
of sexual diseases during the campaign of Charles VIII of France
against Naples. From that time began its strict segregation while
up to then it had been allowed to lead a mild ghetto existence.
The outbursts of ascetic tendencies in Protestantism, especially
in Calvinism, worked against prostitution, as did subsequedtly,
but more mildly and cautiously, the rules of the Catholic church.
The results were here similar to those of Mohammed and the makers
of the Talmud who had likewise taken up the struggle against orgiastic
practices.</P>

<P>An analysis of sex relations outside of marriage must distinguish
between prostitution and the sexual freedom of woman. Sexual freedom
for the man was always taken for granted, being first condemned
by the three great monotheistic religions, and in fact not by
Judaism until the Talmud. The originally equal sexual freedom
of woman finds expression in the fact that among the Arabs at
the time of Mohammed temporary marriage in exchange for support,
and trial marriage, existed side by side, although permanent marriage
was already recognized. Trial marriages are also found in Egypt
and elsewhere. Girls of upper class families were especially reluctant
to submit to the harsh domestic confinement of the patriarchal
marriage, but clung to their sexual liberty, remaining in their
parental homes and entering into contracts with men to whatever
extent they pleased.</P>

<P>Beside this example of personal sexual freedom must be placed
the possibility of the woman being exploited for gain by the clan
and hired out in exchange for provisions. Sex hospitality, so-called,
must also be recognized, that is, the obligatory giving of wife
and daughters to honored guests. Finally, there developed concubinage,
which is distinguished from marriage by the fact that it does
not give complete legitimacy to the children. It is always conditioned
by difference in social class and involves cohabitation across
class barriers, after class endogamy has been established. In
the period of the Roman Empire it had held full legal recognition,
especially for soldiers, to whom marriage was forbidden, and for
senators, whose marriage opportunities were limited by social
class considerations. It was maintained during the middle ages
and first absolutely forbidden by the Fifth General Lateran Council
of 1515. But it was condemned by the Reformation churches from
the beginning, and since that time has disappeared from the western
world as a legally recognized institution. <A NAME="anchor318901"></A>Further
investigation of the socialistic theory of mother-right shows
that none of the stages of sexual life which it asserts can be
shown to exist as steps in a general evolutionary sequence. Where
they are met with, it is always under quite special circumstances.
Promiscuity, where it exists at all, is either an especial phenomenon
of an orgiastic character or a degenerative product of an older
strict regulation of the sexual life. On the side of the mother-right
theory, it must be admitted that the history of animistic religious
belief shows that the connection between the act of generation
and birth was not originally understood. In consequence, the blood
bond between father and children was not recognized, just as today
illegitimate children live under mother-right. However, purely
maternal organizations under which children live with the mother
alone, without the father, are not at all general, but occur only
under quite specific conditions.</P>

<P>Endogamy within the house or brother and sister marave is found
as an aristocratic institution for maintaining purity of the royal
blood, as among the Ptolemies. Priority of the clan, under which
the girl must be offered to members of her clan before marrying
outside of it, or their claim must be bought off, is explained
by differentiation in wealth and is a defense against the dissipation
of property. The levirate also does not correspond to primitive
conditions, but arises from the fact that extinction of a male
line was to be avoided on military and religious grounds; the
family without a warrior must not be left barren and abandoned
to die out. After social stratification has appeared, class endogamy
rises in the further sense that the daughters must be served for
the members of a particular political or economic group. This
was carried out within wide limits the Greek democracy, in order
to keep the property within the citizenship of the city and to
monopolize politic opportunities for the citizen class by restricting
its multiplication.</P>

<P>Endogamy also takes the form of hypergamy, in the case where
very intense class differentiation develops, as the Indian caste
system. While the man of a higher caste can enter into sex relations
or marry below his level, this is forbidden to the woman. As a
result the man of a lower caste may be sold for money ... The
arrangements are made in childhood, and the man may be married
to a number of women and be supported by their parents, travelling
from one household to another. In India, the English government
put an end to this condition enforcing the support of the women
on the part of the nominal husband. Wherever endogamy is found,
it is to be assumed that it is a phenomenon of retrogression,
not a stage of progress.</P>

<P>Exogamy with regard to the household has obtained everywhere
and always, with few exceptions. It arises from the effort to
forestall jealousy of the men within the household, and out of
the recognition that growing up together does not permit a strong
development of the sexual impulse. Exogamy of the clan is generally
connected with animistic ideas belonging to the institution of
totemism. That this ever spread over the world is, however, unproven,
although it is met with in such separated regions as America and
the Indian Archipelago. Marriage by capture is always regarded
as illegal by the kindred affected, justifying blood revenge or
exaction of head money, but at the same time is also treated as
a knightly adventure. (36)</P>

<P>The distinguishing mark of legitimate marriage according to
patriarchal law, is the fact that from the standpoint of a certain
social group only the children of a certain wife of the man in
question have full legal standing. This social group may be of
several kinds: 1. The house community; only children by marriage
have the right of inheritance, not those of secondary wives and
concubines. 2. The clan; only the children by marriage share in
the institutions of blood vengeance, head money, and inheritance.
3. A military group; only children by marriage have the right
to bear arms, share in booty or conquered territory, or in the
distribution of land generally. 4. A class group; only children
by marriage are full members of the class. 5. A religious group;
only legitimate descendants are regarded as fit to carry on the
ancestral ritual, and the gods will accept sacrifice only at their
hands.</P>

<P>The possible arrangements other than legitimate marriage according
to patriarchal law are the following: (1) The pure matriarchate.
The father, recognized as legitimate head of the group, is absent;
kinship is recognized only between the children and the mother
or the kindred of the latter. Pure maternal groupings are found
especially in connection with men's societies. (See below.) (2)
Pure paternal (agnatic) groupings. All the children of a father
have equal standing, including those of secondary wives, concubines,
and female slaves, and also adopted children. Both children and
women are subject to his unrestrained authority. Out of this condition
developed legitimate marriage according to patriarchal law. (3)
Succession in the maternal line in spite of a house community
including both parents. The children belong to the mother's clan,
not that of the father. This condition is found in connection
with totemism and is a survival of the organization of the men's-house
organization. (See below.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(C) THE EVOLUTION OF THE FAMILY AS CONDITIONED BY ECONOMIC
AND NON-ECONOMIC FACTORS</P>

<P>Treatment of this question calls first for a general survey
of primitive economic life. The scheme of three uniformly distinct
stages of hunting economy, pastoral economy, and agriculture,
current in scientific discussion, is untenable. Neither purely
hunting nor purely nomadic peoples are primitive, if they are
met with at all, free from dependence exchange among themselves
and with agricultural tribes. The primitive condition on the contrary
is one of nomadic agriculture on the level of hoe-culture, and
generally associated with hunting. Hoe-culture is husbandry without
domestic animals and especially without beasts of burden; the
plow represents the transition to agriculture in our sense. The
domestication of cattle required a long period of time. It probably
began with work animals, milk animals coming later, while still
today there are regions in the East in which milking is unknown.
Use of animals for meat followed both. As an occasional phenomenon,
slaughtering is certainly older; it took place in a ritualistic
connection for the purpose of the meat orgy. Last of all we find
the taming of animals for military purposes. Beginning with the
16th century before Christ we meet with the horse which is used
on the plains for riding, everywhere else as a draft animal; and
the epoch of knightly chariot fighting, common to all peoples
from China and India to Ireland, begins.</P>

<P>Hoe-culture could be carried on individually by the small family
or with group labor, through the coming together of households
even to hundreds of persons. The latter mode of husbandry is the
product of a considerable development of technique. Hunting must
originally have been carried on in common, though its socialization
was the result of circumstances. The keeping of cattle could be
carried on individually and must have been; in any case, the social
groups engaged in it could not have been very large on account
of the scattering of large herds over extensive areas. Finally,
extensive agriculture could be carried on by all methods, but
the clearing of land called for community action. (38)</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor104148"></A>Cutting across these distinctions
in the mode of husbandry is the form of the division of labor
between the sexes. Originally, the tilling of the soil and the
harvesting fell mainly to the woman. Only when heavy labor, with
the plow instead of the hoe, was required, the man had to participate.
In the house work proper, in which textiles take the leading place,
the woman alone was involved. Man's work included also hunting,
tending domestic animals as far as cattle were concerned - while
the small animals were again the woman's province- wood and metal
working, and finally and before all, war. The woman was a continuous
worker, the man an occasional one; only very gradually, with the
increasing difficulty and intensity of work, was he led on to
continuous labor.</P>

<P>Out of the interaction of these conditions arise two types
of communalization, on the one hand that of house and field work,
and on the other that of hunting and fighting. The first centers
around the woman and on the basis of it she often occupies a dominant
social position; not infrequently she was in complete control.
The women's house was originally the workhouse, while the socialization
of hunting and fighting gave rise to the men's society. But whether
the head of the household was a man or, as among the Indians,
a woman, there was always a traditional bondage and a corresponding
patriarchal position within the house. In contrast, the socialization
of hunting and fighting was carried out under the leadership based
on merit or charism of a chieftain chosen for this purpose. Not
his kinship connections but his warlike and other personal qualities
are decisive; he is the freely chosen leader with a freely chosen
following.</P>

<P>Corresponding to the house community in which the economic
activity of the women is carried on, is found the men's house.
During a precisely limited period of life, embracing from 25 to
30 years, the men live together in a clubhouse apart from their
families. From this as a center are carried on hunting, war, magic,
and the making of weapons and other important iron implements.
The young men frequently obtain wives by capture, carried out
in groups, so that the marriage has a polyandrous character, or
they buy them. Women are forbidden to enter the men's house, in
order to guard its character of secrecy. It is kept sacred by
fear-inspiring surroundings, such as the duc-duc of the South
Pacific Islanders. The avunculate is regularly connected with
the institution of the men's house and often though not always
with maternal kinship, while exogamy of the clan regularly obtains.
As a rule also the group of men is divided into age classes. After
a certain age they withdraw from the men's house and repair to
the village and their wives. Generally the men's house also recognizes
a novitiate. At a certain age the boys are taken out of the families,
carried through magic procedures (circumcision being commonly
included), receive the consecration of young manhood, and take
up their life in the men's house. The place is a sort of barracks,
a military institution giving rise on its disintegration to various
lines of development, as for example, a magical association or
a political secret society on the pattern of the Italian Camorra.
The Spartan avopelov, the Greek phratry, and the Roman curia (coviria)
are examples of the institution. (39, 40)</P>

<P>This primitive military organization did not everywhere come
into being and where it arose it disappeared quickly, either through
a course of demilitarization or through the development of a military
technique favorable to single combat with the requirement of heavy
weapons and a special course of training for the warrior. Chariot
and horseback fighting worked especially in this direction. The
consequence was regularly that the men joined their families,
living with their wives, and military protection was secured not
through the communism of the men's house but through an arrangement
which gave the individual warrior special rights in the land,
enabling him to equip himself. At this time the blood tie becomes
of especial significance, while accompanying it is the primitive
theology of animism or belief in spirits, which everywhere in
the world puts in its appearance in some form.</P>

<P>In the institution of the men's house is apparently to be sought
the origin of totemism, resting on animistic grounds, although
later it becomes independent of the latter. The totem is an animal,
a stone, an artefact, any object whatever, which is viewed as
possessed by a spirit, the members of the totem group standing
in animistic kinship with this spirit. When the totem is an animal,
it must not be killed, for it is of the same blood as the community;
and out of this prohibition grow various ritualistic food prohibitions.
Those belonging to a totem form a culture union, a peace group,
whose members must not fight among themselves. They practise exogamy,
marriage between members of the totem being considered incestuous
and expiated by terrible punishment. Thus one totem stands over
against others as a marriage group. In this regard the totemic
group is a ritualistic conception which often cuts through household
and political groupings. Although the individual father lives
in domestic communion with his wife and children, maternal succession
is rather generally the rule, the children belonging to the mother's
clan and being ceremonially alien to the father. This is the factual
basis of the so-called matriarchate which is thus, along with
totemism, a survival from the period of the men's house. Where
totemism is absent we find a patriarchate, or paternal dominance
with paternal inheritance. (41)</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor345338"></A><!--SELECTION-->The struggle of
the growing tendency toward the patriarchate with an older maternal
system might be decided according to the established land tenure.
Either the soil was allotted in line with economic principles,
that is, it was regarded as the work place of the woman, or in
line with military principles, in which case it was viewed as
the fruit of conquest and a subject for military protection. If
the main burden of tillage fell on the woman, the land was inherited
by the maternal uncle as guardian of the children. If on the contrary
it was viewed as &quot;spear land&quot; the title rested in the
military organization; the children were counted as belonging
to the father, and a further consequence was the exclusion of
the women from rights in the land. The military group sought to
maintain the economic basis of military service on the part of
its members by keeping the allotment of land as a function of
the paternal clan. Out of this endeavor sprang the levirate as
well as the law regarding female heirs, to the effect that the
nearest of kin had the right and duty of marrying a female descendant
who was the last of a line. This institution is met with especially
in Greece.<!--/SELECTION--></P>

<P>The other possibility was that individual property relations
decided between the patriarchate and a maternal organization.
Between economic equals the older form of marriage was apparently
exchange of wives; especially as between households, youths exchanged
their sisters. With differentiation in economic status, the woman
is regarded as labor power and is bought as an object of value,
as a work animal. The men who cannot buy a wife serve for her
or live permanently in her house. Marriage by purchase and marriage
through service, the one with patriarchal law and the other with
maternal, may exist side by side and even in the same household;
hence, neither is a universal institution. The woman always remains
under the authority of a man, either in her own house community
or in that of the man who has bought her. The marriage by purchase,
like marriage through service, may be either polyandrous or polygamous.
While the well-to-do buy wives at will, the propertyless, especially
brothers, often club together for the purchase of a common wife.
(42)</P>

<P>Back of these relations is the &quot;group marriage&quot; which
probably developed out of marriage barriers of a magical significance,
as between totem groups or house communities. The man takes a
group of sisters either one after the other or at the same time,
or a number of women have to be taken over from the other house
community, when they also become the property of the group thus
&quot;marrying&quot; them. Group marriage occurs only sporadically
and is apparently not a general stage in the evolution of marriage.</P>

<P>The wife obtained by purchase is regularly subject to the absolute
patriarchal authority of the man. This supreme power is a primitive
fact. It was always present in principle, as a characteristic
of primitive peoples.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(D) THE EVOLUTION OF THE CLAN</P>

<P>The evolution of the clan will now be described. The Gaelic
word clan means &quot;blood kindred,&quot; and like the corresponding
German word Sippe is identical with the Latin proles. Different
sorts of clans are flrst to be distinquished.</P>

<P>(1) The clan in the sense of a magical kinship of the members
with each other, with food prohibitions, rules for specific ritualistic
behavior toward each other, etc. These are totemic clans.</P>

<P>(2) Military clans (phratries) are associations such as originally
occupied a men's house. The control over descendants which they
exercised has very extensive significance. An individual who does
not go through the novitiate of the men's house and submit to
the exacting practices and tests of strength connected with it,
or who is not received into the cult, is in the terminology of
primitive peoples a &quot;woman&quot; and does not enjoy the political
privileges of men or the economic privileges which go with them.
The military clan maintains its earlier significance long after
the disappearance of the men's house in Athens, for example, it
is the group through which the individual holds his citizenship.</P>

<P>(3) The clan as a blood kinship group of a certain scope. Here
the agnatic clan is most important and the present discussion
will relate solely to it. Its functions are, first to perform
the duty of blood vengeance against outsiders; second, the division
of fines within the group; third, it is the unit for land allotment
in the case of &quot;spear land,&quot; and in Chinese, Israelitish,
and old German law the agnates possess down to historic times
a claim which must be satisfied before land can be sold outside
the clan. The agnatic clan is in this connection a select group;
only the man who is physically and economically competent to equip
himself for fighting is recognized as a clansman. One who cannot
do that must &quot;commend&quot; himself to an overlord or protector,
in whose power he also places himself. Thus the agnatic clan practically
becomes a privilege of property owners.</P>

<P>A clan may be organized or unorganized, the original condition
being rather intermediate. The clan had regularly an elder, although
this is often no longer true in historical times. In principle
he was only a primus inter pares. He acted as arbiter in disputes
between members of the clan, and divided the land among them,
proceeding, to be sure, according to tradition rather than arbitrarily,
as the clan members either had equal rights or were subject at
least to a definitely regulated inequality. The type of clan elder
is the Arabian sheik, who controls his people only by exhortation
and good example, as the principes of Tacitus' Germans rule more
by example than by command. (44)</P>

<P>The clan met very different sorts of fate. In the Occident
it has completely disappeared, and in the Orient been just as
completely maintained. In the period of antiquity the (greek)
and gentes played a large role. Every ancient city was composed
originally of clans and not of individuals. The individual belonged
to the city only as a member of a clan, a military organization
(phratry) and an organization for the distribution of burdens
(phylum). In India also, a membership in a clan is obligatory
among the upper castes, especially the knightly caste, while the
members of the lower and later established castes belong to a
devak, that is, a totemic group. Here the significance of the
clan rests on the fact that the land system is based on enfeoffment
through the head of the clan. Thus we find here also a hereditary
distinction or charism as the principle of land distribution.
One is not noble because one possesses land, but conversely one
has an inherited right to a share in the land because one belongs
to a noble clan. In the feudal system of the Occident, on the
other hand, the land is divided by the feudal lord, in independence
of clan and kinship, and the fealty of the vassal is a personal
bond. In China today the economic system is still semi-communistic
and based on the clans. The clan possesses schools and storehouses
within its separate village, maintains the tillage of the fields,
takes a hand in matters of inheritance, and is responsible for
the misdemeanors of its members. The whole economic existence
of the individual rests on his membership in the clan, and the
credit the individual is normally the credit of his clan. (45)</P>

<P>The disintegration of the clan took place as a result of two
forces. One is the religious force of prophecy; the prophet seeks
to build up his community without regard to clan membership. The
words of Christ, - 'I came not to send peace, but a sword. For
I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the
daughter against her mother&quot; (Matthew 10:34-35); and &quot;If
any man come to me and hate not his father, and mother, and wife,
and children, and brethren and sisters - he cannot be my disciple&quot;
(Luke 14:26) express the program of every prophet in regard to
the clan as an institution. In the middle ages the church strove
to abolish the rights of the clan in inheritance so that it might
retain land willed to it, but it was not alone in this regard.
Among the Jews, certain forces have worked quite similarly. The
clan retained its vitality down to the exile. After the exile
it is true that the plebeians were enrolled in the clan registers
which had earlier been keprt for the upper class families. But
this division into clans disappeared later, probably because the
clan, being originally military in character, had no roots in
the demilitarized Jewish state and there remained only membership
in a confessional group based on descent or on personal adhesion.</P>

<P>The second force which aided in the disintegration of the clan
is the political bureaucracy. In antiquity, we find the greatest
development of the latter in Egypt, under the New Empire. There
no trace of the clan organization is left because the state does
not tolerate it. In consequence, there is equality between man
and woman and sexual freedom of contract; children receive as
a rule the name of their mother. The royal power feared the clan
and encouraged the development of the bureaucracy; the result
of the process contrasts with that in China, where the state was
not strong enough to break the power of the clan.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>(E) EVOLUTION OF THE HOUSE COMMUNITY</P>

<P>The primitive house community is not necessarily a pure communism.
There is frequently a considerable development of proprietorship,
even over the children and further especially over iron tools,
and textile products. There is also a special right of inheritance
of the woman from the woman and of the man from the man. Again
we may find the absolute patria potestas as the normal condition,
or it may be weakened by other organizations as for example the
totemic group or the maternal clan. In one respect the house community
is almost always a pure communism, namely in regard to consumption,
though not in regard to property. From it as a basis proceed various
courses of development, to various results.</P>

<P>The small family may evolve into an expanded household and
this either in the form of a free community or in that of a manorial
household, as the oikos of a landed baron or a prince. The first
resulted generally where the centralization of work developed
on economic grounds, while the manorial development resulted from
political conditions.</P>

<P>Out of the house community developed among the South Slavs
the zadruga, in the Alps the commune. In both cases the head of
the household is generally elected and generally subject to deposition.
The primary condition is pure communism in production. One who
withdraws from the group forfeits all rights to share in its common
possessions. Occasionally in other places, as in Sicily and in
the Orient, a different course of development took place, the
community being organized not communistically but on the basis
of shares, so that the individual could always demand a division
and take his portion wherever he cared to go.</P>

<P>The typical form of the seigniorial development is the patriarchate.
Its distinguishing characteristics are the vesting of property
rights exclusively in an individual, the head of the household,
from whom no one has a right to demand an accounting, and further
the despotic position inherited and held for life by the patriarch.
This despotism extends over wife, children, slaves, stock, and
implements, the familia pecuniaque of the Roman Law, which shows
this type in its classical perfection. This dominium is absolute
and it is a deviation from principle to speak in connection with
the woman of manus or in connection with the children of potestas.
The power of the house father extends with only ritualistic limitations
to the execution, or sale of the wife, and to the sale of the
children or to leasing them out to labor. According to Babylonian,
Roman, and ancient German law, the father can adopt other children
in addition to his own and into full equality with them. There
is no distinction between female slave and wife or between wife
and concubine, or between acknowledged children and slaves. The
former are called liberi only because of the one distinction between
them and slaves that they have a chance sometime to become heads
of families themselves. In short, the system is that of a pure
agnatic clan. It is found in connection with pastoral economy,
also in cases where a knighthood fighting as individuals forms
the military class, or finally, in connection with ancestor worship.
Ancestor worship must, however, not be confused with worship of
the dead; the latter may exist without the former, as for example
in Egypt. Ancestor worship involves rather a union of worship
of the dead with clan membership; on this union rested in China
and Rome, for example, the invulnerable position of the paternal
dominium.</P>

<P>The patriarchal house community no longer exists in its original
condition, unmodified. Its breakdown resulted from the introduction
of class endogamy, according to which the upper-class clans married
their daughters only to equals and demanded that they receive
a status superior to that of female slaves. As soon, moreover,
as the wife ceased to represent primarily labor power - which
also happened first in the upper classes - the man ceased to buy
her as labor power. Then a clan which wished to marry off a daughter
had to provide her with a dowry sufficient to maintain the standards
of her class. The operation of the class principle gave rise to
the distinction between legitimate, monogamous marriage, and the
patriarchal potestas. Marriage with dowry became the normal marriage,
the woman's clan stiuplating that she was to be the head wife
and that only her children could succeed as heirs. It is not true,
as the socialistic theory has assumed, that the interests of the
man in legitimate heirs for his property opened the way to the
development of marriage. The man&#146;s desire for heirs could
have been secured in numerous ways. It was the interest of the
woman in having assured to her children the property of the man
that was decisive. This development, however, by no means involved
by absolute necessity, monogamous marriage. In general, partial
polygamy persisted; in addition to a head wife secondary wives
were kept, whose children posessed limited rights of inheritance
or none at all.</P>

<P>Monogamy as the exclusive form of marriage first arose, so
far as we know, in Rome, being ritualistically prescribed by the
form of Roman ancestor worship. In contrast with the Greeks, among
whom monogamy was known but remained very flexible, the Romans
maintained it rigorously. To its support came later the religious
power of the Christian commandments, and the Jews also, following
the Christian example, established monogamy, but not until the
time of the Carolingians. Legitimate marriage involved a distinction
between concubines and the regular wife, but the female clan went
farther in protecting the interests of the woman. In Rome it first
carried through complete economic and personal emancipation of
the woman from the man, in establishing the so-called free marriage,
which could be terminated at will by either party, and which gave
the woman complete control over her own property, although she
lost all right over the children if the marriage was dissolved.
Even Justinian was not able to abolish this institution. The evolution
of legitimate marriage from the marriage with dowry is manifest
for a long time in the distinction found in many legal systems
between marriage with dowry and marriage without dowry. Examples
are the Egyptians, and the Jews of the middle ages. (49, 50)
