CRAFT GUILDS</FONT></B></P>

<P>A guild is an organization of craft workers specialized in
accordance with the type of occupation. It functions through undertaking
two things, namely, internal regulation of work and monopolization
against outsiders. it</P>

<P>achieves its objective if everyone joins the guild who practices
the craft in the location in question. (136)</P>

<P>Guilds in the sense of unfree organizations were found in late
antiquity and in Egypt, India, and China. These were organizations
for taking care of compulsory contributions to the state. They
arose in<B> </B>connection with the fact that the function of
supplying the political needs of a prince or of a community was
laid upon the various industrial groups and to this end production
was organized on occupational lines. It has been assumed that
the castes of India also arose out of such guilds, but in reality
they grew out of relations between ethnic groups. Already existing
castes were ntilized by the state, which carried out its financing
in kind by requiring that the industry supply products for its
needs. In early antiquity the leiturgical guild is found, especially
in connection with products important for military use. In the
army of the Roman Republic a centuria fabrum or industrial craftsman
existed alongside the knightly centurion. The later Roman state
needed to bring in grain to keep the city population in a<B> </B>good
humor. For this purpose it instituted the organization of the
navicularii, upon whom was laid the task of ship building. Fiscal
considerations brought it about that in the last centuries of
the Empire almost the whole of economic life was thus &quot;leiturgically&quot;
organized. (136, 137)</P>

<P>Guilds are also met with as ritualistic associations. Not all
the Indian castes are guilds, but very many are ritualistic guilds.
Where castes existed, there were no guilds outside of them; and
none were needed, for it is a feature of the caste system that
every type of labor service is assigned to a special caste. (137)</P>

<P>A third form of guild is the free association; this is characteristic
for the middle ages. Its beginnings are possibly found in late
antiquity; at least the Romanized late-Hellenism shows such tendencies
toward organizations with guild characteristics. The wandering
craftsman first appears at the beginning of our era. Without him
the spread of Christianity would never have been possible; it
was in the beginning the religion of the wandering craftsmen,
to whom the Apostle Paul also belonged, and his proverb &quot;he
who does not work shall not eat&quot; expresses their ethics.
However, antiquity knew only the impulses toward free guilds.
In general, the craft work of antiquity has the character, as
far as we can tell, of clan industry based on hereditary charism
- when it was not attached to an oikos, or estate. The guild idea
is entirely wanting in the classical democracy, which is the very
opposite of guild democracy; on the columns of the erechtheion
worked side by side Athenian citizens, free metics, and slaves.
The reasons for its absence are of a partly political, but chiefly
economic sort. Slaves and free persons could not participate in
the same religious ritual. Moreover, the guild is absent where
caste organization exists, because it is quite superfluous, and
it has little significance where clan economy dominates, as in
China. Here the individual craftsman of the town belongs to some
village; there is no citizenship of Pekin, or any city whatever,
and consequently no guild forming a part of the town organization.
In contrast, there are guilds in Islam. Guild revolutions even
took place, although rarely, as in Bukhara. (137, 138)</P>

<P>The spirit of the medieval western guild is most simply expressed
in the proposition, guild policy is livelihood policy. It signifies
the maintenance of a substantial burgherly prosperity for the
members of the guild, in spite of increased competition in consequence
of the narrowing of the opportunities of life; the individual
guild member must obtain the traditional standard of life and
be made secure in it. This conception of the traditional standard
of life is the analogue of the &quot;living wage&quot; of the
present day. The means which the guild adopted to reach this goal
are of interest. (138)</P>

<P>As to internal policy, the guild endeavored by every conceivable
means to provide equality of opportunity for all guild members,
which was also the objective in the case of the division of the
fields into strips by the peasantry. To realize this equality
the development of capitalistic power must be opposed, especially
by preventing the unequal growth of capital in the hands of individual
masters and consequent differentiation among them; one master
must not progress beyond another. To this end, the processes of
work were regulated; no master dared proceed in any other than
the traditional manner. The guild controlled the quality of the
products. It controlled and regulated the number of apprentices
and laborers. It regulated as far as possible the provision of
raw material, - communally insofar as price work obtained at the
time. In addition the guild or the town did the purchasing of
the raw material and disposed of it to the separate masters. As
soon as the transition to price work had taken place and<B> </B>the
craftsman as a petty capitalist possessed sufficient means to
buy his own raw material, the guild demanded proof of the member's
wealth. This practice has held from the 14th century on. Men without
property could be employed by others as wage workers. As soon
as the field of action became restricted the guild was closed
and the numher of masters fixed, though this result was only reached
in places. (138, 139)</P>

<P>Finally, the relation between the individual craftsmen was
regulated. The guild maintained the position that the raw material
must take the longest possible course in the individual shop,
that the individual workman must keep the object worked upon in
hand as long as possible. Hence it was required that the division
of labor should be based on the :final product and not on technical
specialization of operations. In the clothing industry, for example,
the course of production from the flax to the finished garment
was not cut transversely into separate individual processes of
spinning, weaving, dying, finishing etc., but as far as possible
the guilds insisted that specialization relate to final products;
one worker must produce hose, another vests. Consequently, we
find in the medieval lists two hundred guilds where, according
to our way of thinking, counting on a technological basis, two
or three thousand would have been required. The guilds felt a
very justifiable anxiety lest a crosswise division of the process
might place the worker nearest the market m a position to dominate
the others and to depress them to the position of wage workers.</P>

<P>Thus far the guild follows a livelihood policy. However, it
also endeavored to secure and to maintain equality of opportunity
for the members. To this end free competition had to be limited,
and the guilds established various regulations; 1. The technique
of the industry. They fixed the number of workers, and especially
of apprentices, a member might employ; more especially, where
apprenticeship threatened to pass into the employment of cheap
labor, the number of apprentices was limited to one or two for
each master. 2. The form of the raw material. Especially in industries
which had to mix metals, such as bell casting, a fairly strict
control was exercised in order to maintain the quality of the
result and also to exclude unfair competition. 3. The technique
of the industry and the process of production, hence the manner
of preparing malt, of working leather, of finishing cloth, of
dyeing, etc. 4. They controlled the form of tools employed. The
individual guild commonly assumed a monopoly over certain tools,
which it alone was allowed to use; the type of the tool was traditionally
prescribed. 5. The quality which the product must show before
it could be offered on the market. (139, 140)</P>

<P>The guilds also regulated the economic relations of the industry:
1. They set up limitations on the amount of capital, so that no
employing entrepreneur could develop within the guild, overshadowing
other masters and pressing them into his service. To this end,
all association with foreigners outside the guild was forbidden,
although the prohibition was rarely enforced. 2. Those admitted
to the guild were forbidden to work for other masters lest they
might be reduced to the position of journeymen; similarly as to
working for merchants, which was bound to lead immediately to
a putting-out system. The finished product had to be delivered
as wage work for a customer by the guild craftsman who worked
for wages; for price workers, the free marketing of the product
as price work was the ideal. 3. The guilds controlled the buying
opportunities. They forbade forestalling, i. e., no guild member
dared provide himself with raw materials ahead of his fellows.
Not infrequently they established a right of equal sharing; if
a shortage arose any guild member might demand that his brothers
in the guild provide him with raw material at its cost to them.
4. The guilds also opposed individual selling ahead of other members.
To achieve this they often proceeded to compulsory marketing and
strengthened the regulation by forbidding price cutting and enticement
of customers; thus the way was barred to price competition. 5.
They forbade the sale of the products of outsiders; if a member
violated this rule he was rated a merchant and expelled from the
guild. 6. They regulated marketing, through price schedules, with
a view to guaranteeing the traditional standard of life. (140,
141)</P>

<P>Externally, the policy of the guild was purely monopolistic.
1. The guilds strove towards and reached the objective that in
very many cases the policing of the industry in matters affecting
the craft was placed in their hands, and in such cases they maintained
an industrial court. Otherwise they would not have been able to
control the technique and procedure or to maintain equality of
opportunity among members. 2. They strove towards and regularly
achieved compulsory membership in the guild, at least literally,
though it was often evaded in fact. 3. In many cases they succeeded
in establishing a guild district; they everywhere strove for this,
but fully achieved it only in Germany,-in England not at all,
while in France and Italy they achieved partial success. A guild
district means monopoly of a certain territory. Within this district,
in which the guild established complete authority, no industry
could be carried on except that of the guild. This measure was
directed against migratory workers, who to a considerable extent
were suppressed, and against rural industry. As soon as the guilds
obtained power in the towns, their first thought was an endeavor
to suppress competition from the country. 4. In case of a transfer
of the product of one guild into the hands of another, the guilds
set up price tariffs; internally the price was a minimum price,
against outsiders a monopoly price. 5. That the guild regulations
might be effectively carried out, the division of labor must be
as far as possible along occupational lines, not through transverse
division of the process; that is, as already ex lained, a wo rker
must produce a final product from beginning to end and keep it
in his own hands. By all these measures the guilds opposed the
development of large establishments within the guild-eontrolled
industry. What they were not able to prevent was the development
of putting out of work <I>(Verlag), </I>with its implication of
dependence of the craftsmen upon the merchant. (141, 142)</P>

<P>As late products of guild history must be added some further
regulations. These assumed that the guild had already arrived
at the limit of its field of action, that only inter-local division
of labor and capitalistic operation with extension of the market
could create new industrial opportunities. In the first place,
the guilds made the achievement of mastership increasingly difficult.
This goal was reached in the flrst instance through the institution
of the &quot;masterpiece.&quot; A relatively late product of the
development was that, from the 15th century on, strictly economic
specifications were attached to the masterpiece. From the standpoint
of value its production often had no significance or it even had
nonsensical conditions attached; the requirement signified merely
a compulsory period of work without remuneration to exclude persons
without means. In addition to the requirement of the masterpiece,
the masters who had achieved the position of price workers strove
for a monopolistic position by prescribing a certain minimum capital
for the prospective master. (142)</P>

<P>At this point the organization of apprentices and journeymen
appeared, being especially characteristic of continental Europe.
First, the period of apprenticeship was fixed and progressively
lengthened,-in England to seven years, elsewhere to five, and
in Germany to three. After the apprentice finished his instruction
he became a journeyman. For the latter also, a period of unremunerated
work was prescribed. In Germany this condition led to the institution
of the wander years. The journeyman must travel for a certain
time before he was allowed to settle anywhere as a master, an
arrangement which was never known in France, or in England. Finally,
the guild frequently went on to limit the number of masters to
an absolute maximum figure. This measure was not always taken
in the interest of the guild as a monopoly, but was established
by the city (its lord or its council), especially when the latter
feared an insufficient productive capacity in products of military
use or political importance as means of life, as a result of too
large a number of masters. (143)</P>

<P>With the closing of the guild was associated a tendency to
hereditary appropriation of the position of master. The resulting
preference of the sons of masters, and even their sons-in-law,
for admission into the guild is a phenomenon common to all countries
in the middle ages, although it never became a universal rule.
With this development the character of certain parts of medieval
craft work as small capitalism is determined, and corresponding
to this character a permanent class of journeymen originates.
This development took place not only where craft work was carried
on as price work and a certain capital was necessary for the purchase
of raw material and for carrying on the industry, but most commonly
where the limitation of the number of masters was established.
