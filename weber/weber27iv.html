<P>CHAPTER IV, <I>THE MANOR</I><!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--></P>

<P>The inner development of seignorial proprietorship, especially
of the Occidental manor, was conditioned, in the first place,
by political and social class relations. The power of the lord
was composed of three elements, first, land holding (territorial
power) second, possession of men (slavery) and third, appropriation
of political rights, through usurpation or through enfeoffment;
the last applies especially to judicial authority, which became
far the most important single force in connection with the development
in the west.</P>

<P>Everywhere the lords strove to secure &quot;immunity&quot;
(immunitas) as against the political power above them. They forbade
the officials of the prince to come upon their territory, or if
they permitted it the official had to come directly to the lord
himself for the performance of his mission on behalf of the political
authority, such as colleetion of feudal dues or serving of military
summons. With this negative aspect of immunity is connected a
positive aspect. At least a part of the immediate exercise of
rights taken away from the officials of the state became the prerogative
of the holder of the immunity. In this form immunity exists not
merely in the Frankish empire but before it in those of Babylonia,
ancient Egypt and Rome. Decisive is the question of appropriation
of judicial authority. The holder of land and of men everywhere
struggled for this prerogative. In the Moslem Caliplhate he did
not succeed; the judicial authority of the general government
was maintained unimpaired. In contrast, the land holders of the
west usually succeeded in their endeavors. In this part of the
world the lord originally had unlimited judicial power over his
slaves, while free persons were subject only to the jurisdiction
of a popular court. For unfree persons the criminal process of
the official court was final, though it was early true that participation
by the lord could not be avoided. This distinction between free
and unfree became effaced in the course of time, the ower of the
lord over slaves being weakened and that over free men being strengthened.
From the 10th to the 13th century, the public courts increasingly
interfered in the determination of cases affecting slaves; their
criminal cases were often tried before the popular court. Especially
from the 8th to the 12th century, the position of the slaves steadily
improved. With the cessation of the great movements of conquest
the slave trade declined and it became difficult to supply the
slave markets. At the same time the need for slaves increased
greatly, in consequence of the clearing of forests. To secure
and retain slaves, the lord had progressively to improve their
conditions of life. In contrast with the Latin possessor, he was
primarily a warrior and not a farmer, and found himself hardly
in a position to supervise his unfree dependents, so that on that
ground also their situation improved. On the other hand (cf. page
63) his power over the free population was strengthened by changes
in military technique, and resulted in the extension of the household
authority of the lord, originally confined to the familiar over
the whole extent of his territorial dominion. (65, 66)</P>

<P>There is a correspondence between free and unfree conditions
of tenure and free and unfree persons. In this connection we must
consider the precaria and the beneficium. The precaria is a lease
relation based on a documentary application, and entered into
by free persons of every class. Originally it was terminable at
will, but soon evolved into a contract renewable every five years
but in fact for life and usually hereditary. The beneficium is
an enfeoftment in exchange for services, originally of any form
whatever, or under some conditions in exchange for payments. Later
the beneficium differentiates into that of the free vassal, who
bound himself to feudal services, and that of the free man who
bound himself to service on the lord's demesne. In addition to
these forms of lease there was a third, the land settlement lease,
by means of which the overlord was in the habit of granting land
for clearing against a fixed tax and into the hereditary possession
of the grantee. This was the so-called quit-rent (Erbzins), which
later made its way into the towns also. (66, 67)</P>

<P>Over against these three forms, all of which related to land
situated outside the village community (Gutsverband), is the manorial
estate (Fronhof) with the land dependent upon it, of which the
Capitulare de villis of Charlemagne gives a clear picture. Within
the manor was first the seigniorial land, or demesne, including
the terra salica, which was managed directly by the lord's officials
and the terra indominicata, seigniorial holdings in free peasant
villages; and second the holdings or hide land of the peasants.
The latter fell into mansi serviles with unlimited services and
mansi ingenuiles with limited services, according as hand labor
or team work had to be rendered throughout the year or only in
connection with tillage and harvest. The payments in kind and
the whole product of the demesne (called fiscus in the case of
royal holdings) were laid up in a storehouse and used for the
needs of the army and the seigniorial household, any surplus being
sold. (67)</P>

<P>A decided shift in the relations between free and unfree persons
resulted from the establishment of territorially bounded limits
of jurisdiction of the landlord and judge (socage districts or
sokes - Bannbezirke). An obstacle to this at first was the scattered
condition of the holdings; for example, the monastery of Fulda
held some thousand scattered farms. From the early middle ages
on, the holders of judicial and proprietory- rights strove to
consolidate their holdings. This was accomplished in part through
the development of &quot;real-dependency,&quot; the lord refusing
to grant a particular piece of land unless the grantee submitted
at the same time to personal suzerainty. On the other hand, there
developed the manorial law, in consequence of the fact that within
the jurisdiction and seigniorial farm free and unfree persons
were thrown together. Manorial law reached its highest development
in the 13th century. While originally the lord possessed judicial
authority only over the unfree members of his familia and outside
of this exercised authority over the territory of his &quot;immunity&quot;
only on the basis of a royal grant, on his own holdings he had
to deal with persons of various classes who were under obligation
to render exactly the same services. Under these circumstances
the free persons were able to compel the lord to join with all
his dependents in forming a manorial court in which the dependent
persons functioned as magistrates. Thus the lord lost the power
of arbitrary control over the obligations of his dependents and
these became traditionalized (similarly, to the way in which the
soldier councils tried to set themselves up on behalf of soldiers
against officers in the German revolution). On the other hand,
from the 10th to the 12th century was being evolved the principle
that by the mere fact of a land grant the recipient became ipso
jure subject to the judicial authority of the lord of the land.</P>

<P>The consequence of this development was the modification of
the freedom on the one hand and servility on the dependent population.
Modification of free status was politically conditioned by the
judicial authority of the lord in connection with the unarmed
state of the free men, which was due to economic causes, while
the modification of unfree status resulted from teh greatly increased
demand for peasants for clearing the forests and in Germany for
the colonization eastward. Both these cumstances enabled the unfree
to escape the authority of the lords and put the latter in competition
among themselves in granting favorable conditions of life to their
dependents. In addition, the slave trade, and hence the new of
slaves, had ceased, and the available servile persons had to be
treated with consideration. In the same direction of elevating
the dependent classes worked the political situation of the lords.
The lord was not a farmer but rather a professional soldier, and
was not in a position to conduct agriculture effectively. He could
not budget his affairs on the basis of a fluctuating income and
was disposed toward a traditional fixation of the dues of his
dependents and hence toward meeting them on a contractual footing.
(69)</P>

<P>Thus the medieval peasantry became strongly differentiated
within and held together through the power of the lords and the
manorial law. Alongside the dependent classes, there were free
peasants outside the community circle of the lord's estate, on
freehold land subject only to quit-rents, and hence essentially
private owners. Over such persons the lord had no judicial authority.
These free-holders never disappeared entirely, but were found
in considerable numbers in only a few places. One of these is
Norway, where feudalism never developed; they were called &quot;odal&quot;
peasants, in contrast with the landless, un-free classes dependent
upon them. Another such locality is the marsh lands of the North
Sea,- Frisia and Ditmarsh; similarly in parts of the Alps, Tyrol,
and Switzerland, and in England. Finally there are the &quot;mailed
peasantry&quot; of many parts of Russia, who were individual proprietors;
to them were added later the Cossacks as a plebeian soldier class
with the social position of small farmers. (69, 70)</P>

<P>As a consequence of the development of feudalism, when the
landed nobility began to collect the taxes, there arose exemption
from taxation of the nobility itself, with liability to taxation
on the part of the unarmed peasantry. To increase the military
power of the territory, the French feudal law set up the principle
of nulle terre sans setgneur, intended originally to increase
the number of benefices as a guarantee of military strength; on
the same principle rested the compulsory reinfeudations imposed
by the German king in connection with every grant of land. This
differentiation as regards liability to taxation formed the basis
of the policy of the princes in maintaining the peasant holdings.
They could not consent to having the hide land alienated from
the peasant, as the area subject to taxation was thereby decreased.
Thus the territorial princes adopted the system of protecting
the peasantry and forbade the nobility to confiscate the peasant
holdings. (70)</P>

<P>Several economic results also followed: 1. The large household
of the lord and small household of the peasant subsisted side
by side. The dues of the peasants originally served only to satisfy
the requirements of the lord and were readily fixed by tradition.
The peasants had no interest in making the soil yield more than
was necessary for their own maintenance and for covering their
obligatory payments, and the lord had as little interest in increasing
the payments, as long as he did not produce for a market. The
mode of life of the lord was but little different from that of
the peasant. Thus &quot;the walls of his stomach set the limits
to his exploitation of the peasant,&quot; as Karl Marx observed.
The traditionally fixed dues of the peasant class were protected
by manorial law and by community of interest. 2. Since on account
of the taxes involved, the state was interested in maintaining
the peasantry, the jurists took a hand, especially in France.
The Roman law did not generally, as commonly supposed, work toward
the disintegration of the old Germanic peasant law, but on the
contrary was applied in favor of the peasantry, against the nobility.
3. The attachment of the peasantry to the soil. This followed,
in so far as personal fealty arose, or in consequence of the tax
obligation, when the lord became answerable for their taxes; to
an increasing degree also the nobility established it by usurpation.
The peasant could withdraw from the community only by forfeiting
his land and by securing another man to take his place. (70, 71)</P>

<P>4. The rights of the peasant in the land became extraordinarily
diversified. In the case of unfree tenants the lord generally
had the right to resume the holding at death. If he renounced
the exercise of this right, having no tenants to spare, he at
least assessed special dues, the heriot, etc. Free tenants either
held leases terminable at any time or were copy-holders with permanent
rights. In both cases the legal position was clear, but the state
often interfered to forbid the termination of grants - the so-called
tenant right. Among the dependents, who as freemen had originally
commended themselves to a lord, arose an attachment to the lord
and of the lord to them in return. The lord could not simply dismiss
the villein, but as early as the time of the Sachsensplegel was
compelled to pay him a small capital in money. (71)</P>

<P>5. The lords regularly appropriated to themselves the common
mark and often the common pasture or almend as well. Originally,
the chieftain was head of the mark organization Out of the lord's
right of supervision evolved in the course of the Middle Ages
a feudal proprietorship over the mark and the common pasture of
the village. The peasant wars of the 16th century in Germany were
waged primarily against this usurpation, and not anainst excessive
payments and dues. The peasants demanded free pasture and free
woodland, which could not be granted as the land had become too
scarce, and fatal deforestation would have resulted, as in Sicily.
The lord had established in his own favor numerous &quot;socage
rights&quot; or banalitgs (Bannrexhte) such as a compulsion on
the part of the peasant to grind grain at the lord&#146;s mill,
to use his bakery, his oven, etc. These monopolies arose, to begin
with, without compulsion; for only the lord was in a position
to erect mills or other institutions. Later, oppressive force
was used to compel their utilization. Besides these the lord possessed
numerous banalitis in connection with hunting and the transportation
of goods. , They grew out of obliga&not; tions to the chieftain,
transferred to the later judicial overlord, and were exploited
for economic ends.</P>

<P>The exploitation of the subjugated peasantry by the lords was
carried out, with two exceptions, not by means of forced labor,
but by making them into rent-payers. The only two exceptions in
the world will be treated later, in connection with the development
of capitalistic economy within the manor (cf. Chapter VI). The
grounds for this method of exploitation were in the first place
the traditionalism of the lords. They were too lacking in initiative
to build up a business enterprise on a large scale into which
the peasants would have fitted as labor force. In addition, as
long as the cavalry was the core of the army, the lords were bound
by their obligations as vassals and could not be spared for agriculture,
while the peasant could not be spared for war. Moreover, the lord
possessed no movable capital of his own, and preferred to transfer
the risk of active operations to the peasant. Finally, there was
in jai law which bound in Europe the restriction of manor lords,
while in Asia the latter could not rely on sufficient protection
on going over to production for the market, since there was nothing
corresponding to the Roman law at hand. Here there was no development
at all of the demesne (Pronhof) or in-land, farmed by the lord.</P>

<P>The lords secured rentals, in numerous ways: 1. Through feudal
dues, which the free peasant paid in goods, the servile one in
labor. 2. Through fees on occasion of a change in tenant, enforced
by the lord as a condition of the sale of the holding. 3. Fees
in connection with inheritance and marriage, imposed as a condition
of transmitting the land to heirs or for the privilege of letting
the peasant's daughter marry outside the lord's jurisdiction.
4. Fees in connection with woodland and pasture, as for mast in
the forest. 5. Indirect rents secured by imposing on the peasant
transportation charges as well as the burden of building roads
and bridges. The collection of all these fees and payments was
carried out originally through the divillication system which
represents the type of manorial administration for south and west
Germany as well as for France, and is everywhere the oldest form
of feudal organization for the exploitation of land. This system
presupposes the scattering of holdings. The lord sets over each
of his widely separated holdings (Hufen) a villicus or bailiff,
whose duty it is to collect the payments from his neighbors who
are dependents of the lord, and to hold them to the performance
of their obligations.
