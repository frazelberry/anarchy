<P><FONT SIZE="+1">OF THE DOMESTIC SYSTEM</FONT></P>

<P>The disintegration of the guilds, which took place after the
close of the Middle Ages, proceeded along several lines. 1. Certain
craftsmen within the guilds rose to the position of merchant and
capitalist-employer of home workers, i.e. of &quot;factor&quot;
(Verleger). Masters with a considerable invested capital purchased
the raw material, turned over the work to their fellow guildsman
who carried on the process of production for them, and sold the
finished product. The guild organization struggled against this
tendency, but none the less it is the typical course of the English
guild development, especially in London. In spite of the desperate
resistance of the guild democracies against the &quot;older men,&quot;
the guilds were transformed into &quot;livery companies,&quot;
guilds of dealers in which the only full members were those who
produced for the market, while those who had sunk to the level
of wage workers and home workers for others lost the vote in the
guild and hence their share in its control. This revolution first
made possible progress in technique, whereas the dominance of
the guild democracies would have meant its stagnation. In Germany
we do not meet with this course of development; here if a craftsman
became an employer or factor he changed his guild, joining that
of the shopkeepers, or merchant-tailors or constablers, a guild
of upper class importing and exporting merchants. (153)</P>

<P>2. One guild might rise at the expense of another. Just as
we find trading masters in many guilds, others changed entirely
into mercantile guilds, foreign. the members of other guilds into
their employ. This was possible where the production process was
transversely divided. Examples are found in England-tile merchant
tailors - and elsewhere. The 14th century especially is filled
with struggles of the guilds for independence of other guilds.
Frequently both processes run along together; within the individual
guild, certain masters rise to the position of traders and at
the same time many guilds become organizations of traders. The
symptom of this eventuality is regularly the fusion of guilds,
which took place in England and France but not in Germany. Its
opposite is represented by the splitting of the guilds and the
union of the traders, especially common in the 15th and 16th centuries.
The dealers within the guild of walkers, weavers, dyers, etc.
form an organization and in common regulate the whole industry.
roduction processes of diverse cliaracter are united on the level
of small shop industry. (153, 154)</P>

<P>3. Where the raw material was very costly and its importation
demanded considerable capital, the guilds became dependent upon
the importers. In Italy, silk gave occasion to this development,
in Perugia, for example, and similarly for amber in the north.
New raw materials might also provide the impetus. Cotton worked
in this way; as soon as it became an article in general demand,
putting -out enterprises arose along side the guilds or through
their transformation as in Germany, where the Fuggers took a notable
part in the development. (154)</P>

<P>4.The guilds might become dependent upon the exporters. Only
in the beginnings of the industry could the household or tribal
unit peddle its own products. As soon, on the other hand, as an
industry became entirely or strongly based on exportation, the
factor-entrepreneur was indispensable; the individual craftsman
failed in the face of the requirements of exportation. The merchant,
however, possessed not only the necessary capital but also the
requisite knowledge of market operations - and treated them as
trade secrets. (154, 155)</P>

<P>The textile industry became the main seat of the domestic system;
here, its beginnings go back into the early middle ages. From
the 11th century on there was a struggle between wool and linen,
and in the 17th and 18th centuries between wool and cotton, with
the victory of the second in each case. Charlemagne wore nothing
but linen, but later, with increasing demilitarization, the demand
for wool increased and at the same time with the clearing of forest
the fur industry disappeared and furs became constantly dearer.
Woolen goods were the principal commodity in the markets of the
Middle Ages; they play the leading role everywhere, in France,
England and Italy. Wool was always partly worked up in the country,
but became the foundation of the greatness and the economic prosperity
of the medieval city; at the head of the revolutionary movements
in the city of Florence, marched the guilds of the wool workers.
Here again we find early traces of the putting-out system. As
early as the 13th century independent wool factors worked in Paris
for the permanent market of the Champagne fairs. In general we
find the system earliest in Flanders, and later in England, where
the Flanders woolen industry called forth mass production of wool.
(155)</P>

<P>In fact, wool determined the course of English industrial history,
in the form of raw wool, partial products and finished goods.
As early as the 13th and 14th centuries England exported wool
and partial manufactures of wool. Under the initiative of the
dyers and made-up clothing interests, the English woolen industry
finally became transformed tothe basis of exportation of finished
products. (155, 156)</P>

<P>The peculiar feature of this development is that it resulted
in the rise of domestic industry through the rural weavers and
the town merchants. The English guilds became predominantly trading
guilds, and in the final period of the middle ages attached to
themselves rural craftsmen. At this time the garment makers and
the dyers were settled in the towns, the weavers in the country.
Within the city trading guilds broke out finally the struggle
between the dyers and garment makers on the one hand and the exporters
on the other. Export capital and merchant-employer capital became
separated and fought out their conflicts of interest within the
woolen industry under Elizabeth and in the 17th century, while
on the other side employer capital had also to contend with the
craft guilds; this was the first conflict between industrial and
trading capital. This situation, which became characteristic of
all the large industries of England, led to the complete exclusion
of the English guilds from influence on the development of production.
(156)</P>

<P>The further course of events followed different lines in England
and France as compared with Germany, in con sequence of the difference
in the relation between capital and the craft guilds. In England,
and especially in France, the transition to the domestic system
is the universal phenomenon. Resistance to it ceased automatically
without calling forth interference from above. As a result, in
England after the 14th century, a small master class took the
place of the working class. Precisely the opposite happened in
Germany. In England, the development just described signified
the dissolution of the guild spirit. Where we find amalgamation
and fusion of various guilds, the initiative proceeds from the
trading class, which was not to be restrained by guild limitations.
They united within the guilds and excluded the masters without
capital. Thus formally the guilds maintained themselves for a
long time; the suffrage of the city of London, which was nothing
but an organization of wealthy dignitaries, was a guild survival.
(156, 157)</P>

<P>In Germany, the development proceeds in reverse order. Here
the guilds more and more became closed groups in consequence of
the narrowing of the field of subsistence policy, and political
considerations also played a part. In England there was wanting
the particularism of the towns, which dominates the whole of German
economic history. The German town pursued an independent guild
policy as long as it could, even after it was included in the
territorial state of a prince. By contrast, the independent economic
policy of the towns ceased early in England and France, as their
autonomy was cut off. The English towns found the path to progress
open because they were represented in Parliment, and in the 14th
and 15th centuries in contrast with later times - the overwhelming
majority of the representatives came from urban circles. In the
period of the Hundred Years War with France, the Parliament determined
English policy and the interests brought together there pursued
a rational, unitary industrial policy. In the 16th century a uniform
wage was fixed, the adjustment of wages being taken out of the
hands of the justices of the peace and given to the central authority;
this facilitated entry into the guilds, the symptom of the fact
that the capitalistic trading class, who predominated in the guilds
and sent their representatives to parliament, were in control
of the situation. In Germany, on the other hand, the towns, incorporated
in the territorial principalities, controlled the guild policy.
It is true that the princes regulated the guilds in the interests
of peace and order, but in the large their regulative measures
were conservative and carried out in line with the older policy
of the guilds. In consequence the guilds maintained their existence
in the critical period of the 16th and 17th centuries; they were
able to close their organization, and the stream of the unchained
forces of capitalism flowed through England and the Netherlands,
less strongly even through France, while Germany remained in the
background. Germany was as far from the position of leadership
in the early capitalistic movement at the close of the middle
ages and the beginning of the modern era as it had been centuries
before in the development of feudalism. (157, 158)</P>

<P>A further characteristic divergence is the difference in regard
to social stresses. In Germany, from the close of the middle ages
on, we find unions, strikes and revolutions among the journeymen.
In England and France, these became more and more rare since in
those countries the apparent independence of the home-working
small masters beckoned to them and they could work immediately
for the factor. In Germany, on the contrary, this apparent independence
was not available as there was no domestic industry, and the closing
of the guilds established a relation of hostility between the
masters and the journeymen. (158)</P>

<P>The pre-capitalistic domestic industry of the west did not
develop uniformly, or even as a rule, out of the craft organization;
this occurred to the smallest extent in Germany and to a much
greater extent in England. Rather it quite commonly existed side
by side with craft work, in consequence of the substitution of
rural craft workers for urban, or of the fact that new branches
of industry arose throuch the introduction of new raw materials,
especially eotton The crafts struggled against the putting-out
system as long as they could, and longer in Germany than in England
and France. (158, 159)</P>

<P>Typically, the stages in the growth of the domestic system
are the following: 1. A purely factual buying monopoly of the
factor in relation to the craft worker. This was regularly established
through indebtedness; the factor compels the worker to turn over
his product to him exclusively, on the ground of his knowledge
of the market as merchant. Thus the buying monopoly is connected
with a selling monopoly and taking possession of the market by
the factor; he alone knowing where the products were finally to
stop. 2. Delivery of the raw material to the worker by the factor.
This appears frequently, but is not connected with the buying
monopoly of the factor from the beginning. The stage was general
in Europe but was seldom reached elsewhere. 3. Control of the
production process. The factor has an interest in the process
because he is responsible for uniformity in the quality of the
product. Consequently, the delivery of raw material to the worker
is often associated with a delivery of partial products, as in
the 19th century the Westphalian linen weavers had to work up
a prescribed quantity of warp and yarn. 4. With this was connected
not infrequently, but also not quite commonly, the provision of
the tools by the factor; this practice obtained in England from
the 16th century on, while on the continent it spread more slowly.
In general the relation was confined to the textile industry,
there were orders on a large scale for looms for the clothiers
who turned them over to the weavers for a rental. Thus the worker
was entirely separated from the means of production, and at the
same time the entrepreneur strove to monopolize for himself the
disposal of the product. 6. Sometimes the factor took the step
of combining several stages in the production process; this also
was not very common, and was most likely to occur in the textile
industry. He bought the raw material and put it out to the individual
workman, in whose hands the product remained until it was finished.
When this stage was reached the craft worker again had a master,
in quite the same sense as the craftsman on an estate, except
that in contrast with the latter he received a money wage and
an entrepreneur producing for the market took the place of the
aristocratic household. (159, 160)</P>

<P>The ability of the putting-out system to maintain itself so
long rested on the unimportance of fixed capital. In weaving,
this consisted only of the loom; in spinning, prior to the invention
of mechanical spinniny machines, it was still more insignificant.
The capital remained in the possession of the independent worker,
and its constituent parts were decentralized, not concentrated
as in a modern factory, and hence without special importance.
Although the domestic system was spread widely over the earth,
yet this last stage, the provision of the tools and the detailed
direction of production in its various stages by the factor, was
reached comparatively seldom outside the western world. As far
as can be learned, no trace whatever of the system survived from
antiquity, but in China and India it was present. Where it dominated,
craftsmen might none the less in form continue to exist. Even
the guild with journeymen and apprentices might remain, though
divested of its original significance. It became either a guild
of home workers - not a modern labor organization but at most
a forerunner of such, - or within the guild there might be a differentiation
between wage workers and masters. (160)</P>

<P>In the form of capitalistic control of unfree labor power,
we find house industry spread over the world, as manorial, monastic
and temple industry. As a free system it is found in connection
with the industrial work of peasants; the cultivator gradually
becomes a home worker producing for the market. In Russia especially,
industrial development took this course. The &quot;kustar&quot;
originally brought only the surplus production of the peasant
household to market, or peddled it through third parties. Here
we have a rural industry which does not take its course toward
tribal industry but goes over into the domestic system. Quite
the same thing is found in the east and in Asia, - in the east,
it is true, strongly modified by the bazaar system, in which the
work place of the craftsman is separate from his dwelling and
closely connected with a general centralized market place in order,
as far as possible, to guard against dependence on the merchant;
to a certain extent this represents an intensification of the
medieval guild system. (160, 161)</P>

<P>Dependence of urban as well as rural craft workers upon an
employer (factor or &quot;putter out&quot;) is met with. China
especially affords an example, though the clan retails the products
of its members and the connection with clan industry obstructed
the development of domestic industry. In India the castes stood
in the way of the complete subjugation of the craftsman by the
merchant. Down to recent times the merchant was unable to obtain
possession of the means of production to the extent we find true
elsewhere, because these were hereditary in the caste. None the
less, the domestic system in a primitive form developed here.
The last and essential reason for its retarded development in
these countries as compared with Europe is found in the presence
of unfree workers and the magical traditionalism of China and
India. (161)
