<P>CHAPTER Vl</P>

<P>THE POSITION OF THE PEASANTS IN VARIOUS WESTERN COUNTRIES BEFORE
THE ENTRANCE OF CAPITALISM</P>

<P>France.- <!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->Originally there
were slaves (serfs) and half-free persons side by side. The slaves
may be serfs de corps, subject to unlimited services, and over
whom the lord has absolute authority short of life and death,
or they may be serfs de mainmorte with limited service and the
right of withdrawal; but the lord has the right of resuming disposal
over the land on the death or removal of the tenant. The half-free
peasants or villeins have the right of transferring their lands,
and render fixed services or payments - the sign of an originally
free status. These relations underwent extensive transformations
as a result of two sets of circumstances. In the first place,
the numbers of the servile population were notably reduced by
wholesale emancipations as early as the 12th and 13th centuries.
This took place contemporaneously and in connection with the introduction
of money economy. It was in accord with the selflsh interests
of the lord, since free peasants could be made to bear much heavier
burdens of dues.</P>

<P>A further cause was the origin of peasant unions. The village
community organized itself as a corporation which assumed a joint
obligation for the rents of the lord, in return for full autonomy
in administration, which autonomy was also protected by the king.
Both sides obtained an advantage from the arrangement: the lord
because he had only one debtor to deal with, and the peasants
because their power was enormously increased. Temporarily, the
unions were even summoned to the Estates General.</P>

<P>The nobility found the change the more convenient the more
they evolved - in contrast with the Prussian Junkers of the time
- into a courtier nobility, a class of rentiers living far from
the land and no longer representing any organization for work,
so that they were easily eliminated from the economic organization
of the country in a single revolutionary night.</P>

<P>Italy.- The original agrarian organization was in this case
changed at an early date through the buying up of the land by
the townsmen, or expropriation of the occupiers in connection
with political turmoil. The Italian towns early did away with
personal servitude, limited the services and payments of the peasants
and introduced cultivation on the shares, not originally with
capitalistic designs but to cover the needs of the proprietors.
The share tenants had to furnish the table supplies of the patricians,
each being under obligation to supply a different sort of prodnet.
The movable capital was regularly furnished by the propertied
townsman, who did not wish to employ his wealth in capitalistic
agriculture. This system of share tenantry distinguished Italy
and Southern France from other countries of Europe.</P>

<P>Germany.- Northwestern and south western Germany and the adjacent
parts of northern France were the region especially characterized
by the vacation organization, with scattered holdings, referred
to at the close of the preceding chapter. From this as a beginning
the development of agricultural organization proceeded by very
different courses in the southwest and the northwest. In southwest
Germany the vacation system disintegrated. The rights of the lord
to the land, to personal fealty, and the justiciary right, became
transformed into a simple right to receive a rental, while only
relatively few compulsory services and dues in connection with
the transfer of inheritance remained as relics. The Rhenish or
southwest German peasant thus became in fact his own master, able
to sell his holding or transmit it to heirs. This came about primarily
because manorial law developed its greatest power here and because
holdings were extremely scattered; several land holders often
lived in one village. Land holding, judicial authority, and liege-lordship
were in different hands, and the peasant was able to play off
one against the other. The chief gain which the land holders were
able to secure in west and southwest Germany was the appropriation
of large portions of the common mark, and to a much smaller extent,
of the common pasture.</P>

<P>In northwest Germany the villication system was dissolved by
the landholders. As soon as they saw a possibility of marketing
their products they became interested in an increase in the income
from the land and in securing holdings suited to production for
the market. Consequently, at the time of the Sachsenspiegel, and
even a little earlier, there were wholesale emancipations of the
serfs. The land thus liberated was leased for definite periods
to free renters called &quot;Meier&quot; whose property became
hereditary under strong pressure from the state, which protected
them against unexpected increases in rental. If the proprietor
wished to evict a tenant, the state compelled him to secure another
peasant, so that the tax revenue would not be decreased. The interest
of the lords in large holdings led to a law of single inheritance,
the lord forcing the assumption of the holding by an heir. As
a rule the rent was paid in kind, while money payments took the
place of the compulsory feudal services. In certain parts of Westphalia,
serfdom had persisted, but only to the extent that the lord could
resume a part of the inheritance on the death of the tenant. In
the southeast - Bavaria, the upper Palatinate and southern Wurtemberg
- the property rights of the peasant were often insecure. A distinction
was made between hereditary tenure (Erbstift) and non-hereditary
(Letbgeding) and also between protected leases and unrestricted
leases (Schutzlehen and Vollehen). The latter were only for life
and permitted the lord to increase the payments at the death of
a holder or to grant the holding to someone else. The lord himself
usually stood out for the law of compulsory inheritance. The payments
consisted of tithes, and fees on occasion of change of tenant.
Their amount depended on the hereditary or non-hereditary character
of the property. The labor dues were very moderate. Personal bondage
was the rule down to the 18th century, but signified nothing beyond
a very small and modest and variously limited obligatory payment
to the personal overlord who was often separated from the lord
of the land.</P>

<P>Eastern Germany showed, down to the 16th century, the most
ideal legal position of the peasantry. The cultivators usually
held the land on terms of a quit-rent, rendered no labor services,
and were personally free. Relatively large masses of land were
in the hands of nobles who from the beginning were endowed with
large-hides, often three or four or more in a single village.
Judicial authority and land holding were identified to a considerable
extent. This peculiarity made it easier later to subject the tenants
to compulsory services and to convert into large scale farms the
holdings which the nobles managed directly.</P>

<P>In England, there were villains in gross who were serfs and
villains regardant who were technically in a higher position;
they were strictly attached to the soil but were members of a
popular court. Manorial law became very strong, making it difficult
for the lords to oppress the peasants or increase their obligatory
payments. The title to the land and the juridical authority were
identified, and at the time of the Norman conquest unified districts
were granted to vassals. But over the land holders stood a strong
state, and the English kings possessed in their royal courts and
trained jurists a power which put them in a position to protect
the peasantry against the feudal landlords.
