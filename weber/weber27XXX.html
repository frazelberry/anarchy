<P>CHAPTER XXX, <I>THE EVOLUTION OF THE CAPITALISTIC SPIRIT</I></P>

<P>It is a widespread error that the increase of population is
to be included as a really crucial agent in the evolution of western
capitalism. In opposition to this view, Karl Marx made the assertion
that every economics epoch has its own law of population, and
although this proposition is untenable in so general a form, it
is justified in the present case.  The growth of population in
the west made most rapid progress from the beginning of the 18th
century to the end of the 19th.  In the same period China experienced
a population growth of at least equal extent - from 60 or 70 to
400 millions, allowing for the inevitable exaggerations; this
corresponds approximately with the increase in the west.  In spite
of this fact, capitalism went backward in China and not forward.
 The increase in the population took place there in different
strata than with us.  It made China the seat of a swarming mass
of small peasants; the increase of a class corresponding to our
proletariat was involved only to the extent that a foreign market
made possible the employment of coolies (&quot; coolie&quot; is
originally an Indian expression, and signifies neighbor or fellow
member of a clan).  The growth of population in Europe did indeed
favor the development of capitalism, to the extent that in a small
population the system would have been unable to secure the necessary
labor force, but in itself it never called forth that development.
(352)</P>

<P>Nor can the inflow of precious be regarded, as Sombart suggests,
as the primary cause of the appearance of capitalism. It is certainly
true that in a given situation an increase in tne supply of precious
metals may give rise to price revolutions, such as that which
took place after 1530 in Europe, and when other favorable conditions
are present, as when a certain form of labor organization is in
process of development, the progress may be stimulated by the
fact that large stocks of cash come into the hands of certain
groups.  But the case of India proves that such an importation
of precious metal will not alone bring about capitalism.  In India
in the period of the Roman power, an enormous mass of precious
metal-some twenty-five million sestertii annually came in in exchange
for domestic goods, but this inflow gave rise to commercial capitalism
to only a slight extent.  The<BR>
greater part of the precious metal disappeared in the hoards of
the rajahs instead of being converted into cash and applied in
the establishment of enterprises of a rational capitalistic character.
 This fact proves that it depends entirely upon the nature of
the labor system what tendency will result from an inflow of precious
metal.  The gold and silver from America, after the discovery,
flowed in the first place to Spain; but in that country a recession
of capitalistic development took place parallel with the importation.
 There followed, on the one hand, the suppression of the communeros
and the destruction of the commercial interests of the Spanish
grandees, and, on the other hand, the employment of the money
for military ends.  Consequently, the stream of precious metal
flowed through Spain, scarcely touching it, and fertilized other
countries, which in the 15th century were already undergoing a
process of transformation in labor relations which was favorable
to capitalism. (352, 353)</P>

<P>Hence neither the growth of population nor the importation
of precious metal called forth western capitalism.  The external
conditions for the development of capitalism are rather, first.
geographical in character. In China and India the enormous costs
of transportation, connected with the decisively inland commerce
of the regions, necessarily formed serious obstructions for the
classes who were in a position to make profits through trade and
to use trading capital in the construction of a capitalistic system,
while in the west the position of the Mediterranean as an inland
sea, and the abundant interconnections through the rivers, favored
the opposite development of international commerce.  But this
factor in its turn must not be overestimated.  The civilization
of antiquity was distinctively coastal.  Here the opportunities
for commerce were very favorable, (thanks to the character of
the Mediterranean Sea,) in contrast with the Chinese waters with
their typhoons, and yet no capitalism arose in antiquity.  Even
in the modern period the capitalistic development was much more
intense in Florence than in Genoa or in Venice. Capitalism in
the west was born in the industrial cities of the interior, not
in the cities which were centers of sea trade. (353, 354)</P>

<P>Military requirements were also favorable, though not as such
but because of the special nature of the particular needs of the
western armies.  Favorable also was the luxury demand, though
again not in itself.  In many cases rather it led to the development
of irrational forms, such as small work shops in France and compulsory
settlements of workers in connection with the courts of many German
princes.  In the last resort the factor which produced capitalism
is the rational permanent enterprise, rational accounting, rational
technology and rational law, but again not these alone. Necessary
complementary factors were the rational spirit, the rationalization
of the conduct of life in general, and a rationalistic economic
ethic. (354)</P>

<P>At the beginning of all ethics and the economic relations which
result, is traditionalism, the sanctity of tradition, the exclusive
reliance upon such trade and industry as have come down from the
fathers.  This traditionalism survives far down into the present;
only a human lifetime in the past it was futile to double the
wages of an agricultural laborer in Silesia who mowed a certain
tract of land on a contract, in the hope of inducing him to increase
his exertions.  He would simply have reduced by half the work
expended because with this half he would have been able to earn
twice as much as before (sic).  This general incapacity and indisposition
to depart from the beaten paths is the motive for the maintenance
of tradition. (354, 355)</P>

<P>Primitive traditionalism may, however, undergo essential intensification
through two circumstances.  In the first place, material interests
may be tied up with the maintenance of the tradition.  When for
example in China, the attempt was made to change certain roads
or to introduce more rational means or routes of transportation,
the perquisites of certain officials were threatened; and the
same was the case in the middle ages in the west, and in modern
times when railroads were introduced.  Such special interests
of officials, landholders and merchants assisted decisively in
restricting a tendency toward rationalization.  Stronger still
is the effect of the stereotyping of trade on magical grounds,
the deep repugnance to undertaking any change in the established
conduct of life because supernatural evils are feared.  Generally
some injury to economic privilege is concealed in this opposition,
but its effectiveness depends on a general belief in the potency
of the magical processes which are feared.  (355)</P>

<P>Traditional obstructions are not overcome by the economic impulse
alone.  The notion that our rationalistic and capitalistic age
is characterized by a stronger economies interest than other periods
is childish; the moving spirits of modern capitalism are not possessed
of a stronger economic impulse than, for example, an oriental
trader.  The unchaining of the economic interest merely as such
has produced only irrational results; such men as Cortez and Pizarro,
who were perhaps its strongest embodiment, were far from having
an idea of a rationalistic economic life.  If the economic impulse
in itself is universal, it is an interesting question as to the
relations under which it becomes rationalized and rationally tempered
in such fashion as to produce rational institutions of the character
of capitalistic enterprise. (355, 356)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Originally, two opposite attitudes toward the pursuit of gain
exist in combination.  Internally, there is attachment to tradition
and to the pietistic relations of fellow members of tribe, clan,
and house-community, with the exclusion of the unrestricted quest
of gain within the circle of those bound together by religious
ties; externally, there is absolutely unrestricted play of the
gain spirit in economic relations, every foreigner being originally
an enemy in relation to whom no ethical restrictions apply; that
is, the ethics of internal and external relations are categorically
distinct. The course of development involves on the one hand the
bringing in of calculation into the traditional brotherhood, displacing
the old religious relationship.  As soon as accountability is
established within the family community, and economic relations
are no longer strictly communistic, there is an end of the naive
piety and its repression of the economic impulse.  This side of
the development is especially characteristic in the west.  At
the same time there is a tempering of the unrestricted quest of
gain with the adoption of the economic principle into the internal
economy.  The result is a regulated economic life with the economic
impulse functioning within bounds. (356)</P>

<P>In detail, the course of development has been varied.  In India,
the restrictions upon gain-seeking apply only to the two uppermost
strata, the Brahmins and the Rajputs.  A member of these castes
is forbidden to practice certain callings.  A Brahmin may conduct
an eating house, as he alone has clean hands; but he, like the
Raiput, would be unclassed if he were to lend money for interest.
 The latter, however, is permitted to the mercantile castes, and
within it we find a degree of unscrupulousness in trade which
is unmatched anywhere in the world.  Finally, antiquity had only
legal limitations on interest, and the proposition caveat emptor
characterizes Roman economic ethics.  Nevertheless no modern capitalism
developed there. (356, 357)</P>

<P>The final result is the peculiar fact that the germs of modern
capitalism must be sought in a region where officially a theory
was dominant which was distinct from that of the east and of classical
antiquity and in principle strongly hostile to capitalism.  The
ethos of the classical economic morality is summed up in the old
judgment passed on the merchant, which was probably taken from
primitive Arianism: homo Mercator vix aut numquam potest Deo placere;
he may conduct himself without sin but cannot be pleasing to God.
 This proposition was valid down to the 15th century, and the
first attempt to modify it slowly matured in Florence under pressure
of the shift in economic relations. (357)</P>

<P>The typical antipathy of Catholic ethics, and following that
the Lutheran, to every capitalistic tendency, rests essentially
on the repugnance of the impersonality of relations within a capitalist
economy.  It is this fact of impersonal relations which places
certain human affairs out side the church and its influence, and
prevents the latter from penetrating them and transforming them
along ethical lines.  The relations between master and slave could
be subjected to immediate ethical regulation; but the relations
between the mortgage creditor and the property which was pledged
for the debt, or between an endorser and the bill of exchange,
would at least be exceedingly difficult if not impossible. to
moralize. The final consequence of the resulting position assumed
by the church was that medieval economic ethics excluded higgling,
overpricing and free competition, and were<BR>
based on the principle of just price and the assurance to everyone
of a chance to live. (358, 359)</P>

<P>For the breaking up of this circle of ideas the Jews cannot
be made responsible as Sombart does. The position of the Jews
during the middle ages may be compared sociologically with that
of an Indian caste in a world otherwise free from castes; they
were an outcast people.  However, there is the distinction that
according to the promise of the Indian religion the caste system
is valid for eternity.  The individual may in the course of time
reach heaven through a course of reincarnations, the time depending
upon his deserts; but this is possible only within the caste system.
 The caste organization is eternal, and one who attempted to leave
it would be accursed and condemned to pass in hell into the bowels
of a dog.  The Jewish promise, on the contrary, points toward
a reversal of caste relations in the future world as compared
with this.  In the present world the Jews are stamped as an outcast
people, either as punishment for the sins of their fathers, as
Deutero-Isaiah holds, or for the salvation of the world, which
is the presupposition of the mission of Jesus of Nazareth; from
this position they are to be released by a social revolution.
 In the middle ages the Jews were a guest-people standing outside
of political society; they could not be received into any town
citizenship group because they could not participate in the communion
of the Lord's Supper, and hence could not belong to the coniuratio.
(358)</P>

<P>The Jews were not the only guest people (see pages 196, 217);
besides them the Caursines, for example, occupied a similar position.
 These were Christian merchants who dealt in money and in consequence
were, like the Jews, under the protection of the princes and on
consideration of a payment enjoyed the privilege of carrying on
monetary dealings.  What distinguished the Jews in a striking
way from the Christian guest-peoples was the impossibility in
their case of entering into commercium and conubium with the Christians.
 Originally the Christians did not hesitate to accept Jewish hospitality,
in contrast with the Jews themselves who feared that their ritualistic
prescriptions as to food would not be observed by their hosts.
 On the occasion of the first outbreak of medieval anti-Semitism
the faithful were warned by the synods not to conduct themselves
unworthily and<BR>
hence not to accept entertainment from the Jews who on their side
despised the hospitality of the Christians.  Marriage with Christians
was strictly impossible, going back to Ezra and Nehemiah. (359)</P>

<P>A further ground for the outcast position of the Jews arose
from the fact that Jewish craftsmen existed; in Syria there had
even been a Jewish knightly class, though only exceptionally Jewish
peasants, for the conduct of agriculture was not to be reconciled
with the requirements of the ritual.  Ritualistic considerations
were responsible for the concentration of Jewish economic life
in monetary dealings (cf. above page 196).  Jewish piety set a
premium on the knowledge of the law and continuous study was very
much easier to combine with exchange dealings than with other
occupations.  In addition, the prohibition against usury on the
part of the church condemned exchange dealings, yet the trade
was indispensable and the Jews were not subject to the ecclesiastical
law. (359)</P>

<P>Finally, Judaism had maintained the originally universal dualism
of internal and external moral attitudes, under  which it was
permissible to accept interest from foreigners who did not belong
to the brotherhood or established association.  Out of this dualism
followed the sanctioning of other irrational economic affairs,
especially tax farming and political financing of all sorts. 
In the course of the centuries the Jews acquired a special skill
in these matters which made them useful and in demand.  But all
this was pariah capitalism, not rational capitalism such as originated
in the west.  In consequence, hardly a Jew is found among the
creators of the modern economic situation, the large entrepreneurs;
this type was Christian and only conceivable in the field of Christianity.
 The Jewish manufacturer, on the contrary, is a modern phenomenon.
 If for no other reason, it was impossible for<BR>
the Jews to have a part in the establishment of rational capitalism
because they were outside the craft organizations.  But even alongside
the guilds they could hardly maintain themselves, even where,
as in Poland, they had command over a numerous proletariat which
they might have organized in the capacity of entrepreneurs in
domestic industry or as manufacturers.  After all, the genuine
Jewish ethic is specifically traditionalism, as the Talmud shows.
 The horror of the pious Jew in the face of any innovation is
quite as great as that of an individual among any primitive people
with institutions fixed by the belief in magic. (360)</P>

<P>However, Judaism was none the less of notable significance
for modern rational capitalism, insofar as it transmitted to Christianity
the latter's hostility to magic.  Apart from Judaism and Christianity,
and two or three oriental sects (one of which is in Japan), there
is no religion with the character of outspoken hostility to magic.
 Probably this hostility arose through the circumstance that what
the Israelites found in Canaan was the magic of the agricultural
god Baal, while Jahveh was a god of volcanoes, earthquakes, and
pestilences.  The hostility between the two priesthoods and the
victory of the priests of Jahveh discredited the fertility magic
of the priests of Baal and stigmatized it with a character of
decadence and godlessness.  Since Judaism made Christianity possible
and gave it the character of a religion essentially free from
magic, it rendered an important service from the point of view
of economic history.  For the dominance of magic outside the sphere
in which Christianity has prevailed is one of the most serious
obstructions to the rationalization of economic life.  Magic involves
a stereotyping of technology and economic relations.  When attempts
were made in China to inaugurate the building of railroads and
factories a conflict with geomancy ensued.  The latter demanded
that in the location of structures on certain mountains, forests,
rivers, and cemetery hills, foresight should be exercised in order
not to disturb the rest of the spirits. Similar is the relation
to capitalism of the castes in India.  Every new technical process
which an Indian employs signifies for him first of all that he
leaves his caste and falls into another, necessarily lower.  Since
he believes in the transmigration of souls, the immediate significance
of this is that his<BR>
chance of purification is put off until another re-birth.  He
will hardly consent to such a change.  An additional fact is that
every caste makes every other impure.  In consequence, workmen
who dare not accept a vessel filled with water from each other's
hands, cannot be employed together in the same factory room. 
Not until the present time, after the possession of the country
by the English for almost a century, could this obstacle be overcome.
 Obviously, capitalism could not develop in an economic group
thus bound hand and foot by magical beliefs. (361)</P>

<P>In all times there has been but one means of breaking down
the power of magic and establishing a rational conduct of life;
this means is great rational prophecy.  Not every prophecy by
any means destroys the power of magic; but it is possible for
a prophet who furnishes credentials in the shape of miracles and
otherwise, to break down the traditional sacred rules.  Prophecies
have released the world from magic and in doing so have created
the basis for our modern science and technology, and for capitalism.
 In China such prophecy has been wanting.  What prophecy there
was has come from the outside as in the case of Lao-Tse and Taoism.
 India, however, produced a religion of salvation; in contrast
with China it has known great prophetic missions.  Blut they were
prophecies by example; that is, the typical Hindu prophet, such
as Buddha, lives before the world the life which leads to salvation,
but does not regard himself, as one sent from God, to insist upon
the obligation to lead it; he takes the position that whoever
wishes salvation, as an end freely chosen, should lead the life.
However, one may reject salvation, as it is not the destiny of
everyone to enter at death into Nirvana, and only philosophers
in the strictest sense are prepared by hatred of this world to
adopt the stoical resolution and withdraw from life. (362)</P>

<P>The result was that Hindu prophecy was of immediate significance
for the intellectual classes.  These became forest dwellers and
poor monks.  For the masses, however, the significance of the
founding of a Buddhistic sect was quite different, namely the
opportunity of praying to the saints.  There came to be holy men
who were believed to work miracles, who must be well fed so that
they would repay this good deed by guaranteeing a better reinearnation
or through granting wealth, long life, and the like, that is,
this world's goods.  Hence Buddhism in its pure form was restricted
to a thin stratum of monks.  The laity found no ethical precepts
according to which life should be molded; Buddhism indeed had
its decalogue, but in distinction from that of the Jews it gave
no binding commands but only recommendations.  The most important
act of service was and remained the physical maintenance of the
monks.  Such a religious spirit could never be in a position to
displace magic but at best could only put another magic in its
place. (362, 363)</P>

<P>In contrast with the ascetic religion of salvation of India
and its defective action upon the masses, are Judaism and Christianity,
which from the beginning have been plebeian religions and have
deliberately remained such. The struggle of the ancient church
against the Gnostics was nothing else than a struggle against
the aristocracy of the intellectuals, such as is common to ascetic
religions, with the object of preventing their seizing the leadership
in the church.  This struggle was crucial for the success of Christianity
among the masses, and hence for the fact that magic was suppressed
among the general population to the greatest possible extent.
 True, it has not been possible even down to today to overcome
it entirely, but it was reduced to the character of something
unholy, something diabolic. (363)</P>

<P>The germ of this development as regards magic is found far
back in ancient Jewish ethics, which is much concerned with views
such as we also meet with in the proverbs and the so-called prophetic
texts of the Egyptians. But the most important prescriptions of
Egyptian ethics were futile when by laying a scarab on the region
of the heart one could prepare the dead man to successfully conceal
the sins committed, deceive the judge of the dead, and thus get
into paradise.  The Jewish ethics knows no such sophisticated
subterfuges and as little does Christianity.  In the Eucharist
the latter has indeed sublimated magic into the form of a sacrament,
but it gave its adherents no such means for evading the final
judgment as were contained in Egyptian religion.  If one wishes
to study at all the influence of a religion on life one must distinguish
between its official teachings and this sort of actual procedure
upon which in reality, perhaps against its own will, it places
a premium, in this world or the next. (363, 364)</P>

<P>It is also necessary to distinguish between the virtuoso religion
of adepts and the religion of the masses.  Virtuoso religion is
significant for everyday life only as a pattern; its claims are
of the highest, but they fail to determine everyday ethics.  The
relation between the two is different in different religions.
 In Catholicism, they are brought into harmonious union insofar
as the claims of the religious virtuoso are held up alongside
the duties of the laymen as consilia evangelica.  The really complete
Christian is the monk; but his mode of life is not required of
everyone, although some of his virtues in a qualified form are
held up as ideals.  The advantage of this combination was that
ethics was not split asunder as in Buddhism.  After all the distinction
between monk ethics and mass ethics meant that the most worthy
individuals in the religious sense withdrew from the world and
established a separate community. (364)</P>

<P>Christianity was not alone in this phenomenon, which rather
recurs frequently in the history of religions, as is shown by
the powerful influence of asceticism, which signifies the carrying
out of a definite, methodical.conduct of life.  Asceticism has
always worked in this sense.  The enormous achievements possible
to such an aseetically determined methodical conduct of life are
demonstrated by the example of Tibet.  The country seems condemned
by nature to be an eternal desert; but a community of celibate
ascetics has carried out colossal construction works in Lhassa
and saturated the country with the religious doctrines of Buddhism.
 An analogous phenomenon is present in the middle ages in the
west.  In that epoch the monk is the first human being who lives
rationally, who works methodically and by rational means toward
a goal, namely the future life.  Only for him<BR>
did the clock strike, only for him were the hours of the day divided-for
prayer.  The economic life of the monastic communities was also
rational.  The monks in part furnished the officialdom for the
early middle ages; the power of the doges of Venice collapsed
when the investiture struggle deprived them of the possibility
of employing churchmen for oversea enterprises. (364, 365)</P>

<P>But the rational mode of life remained restricted to the monastic
circles.  The Franciscan movement indeed attempted through the
institution of the ternaries to extend it to the laity, but the
institution of the confessional was a barrier to such an extension.
 The church domesticated medieval Europe by means of its system
of confession and penance, but for the men of the middle ages
the possibility of unburdening themselves through the channel
of the confessional, when they had rendered themselves liable
to punishment, meant a release from the consciousness of sin which
the teachings of the church had called into being.  The unity
and strength of the methodical conduct of life were thus in fact
broken up.  In its knowledge of human nature the church did not
reckon with the fact that the individual is a closed unitary ethical
personality, but steadfastly held to the view that in spite of
the warnings of the confessional and of penances, however strong,
he would again fall away morally; that is, it shed its grace on
the just and the unjust. (365)</P>

<P>The Reformation made a decisive break with this system. The
dropping of the concilia evangelica by the Lutheran Reformation
meant the disappearance of the dualistic ethics, of the distinction
between a universally binding morality and a specifically advantageous
code for virtuosi.  The other-worldly asceticism came to an end.
 The stern religious characters who had previously gone into monasteries
had now to practice their religion in the life of the world. 
For such an asceticism within the world the ascetic dogmas of
Protestantism created an adequate ethics.  Celibacy was not required,
marriage being viewed simply as an institution for the rational
bringing up of children.  Poverty was not required, but the pursuit
of riches must not lead one astray into reckless enjoyment.  Thus
Sebastian Franck was correct in summing up the spirit of the Reformation
in the words, &quot;you think you have escaped from the monastery,
but everyone must now be a monk throughout his life.&quot; (365,
366)</P>

<P>The wide significance of this transformation of the ascetic
ideal can be followed down to the present in the classical lands
of Protestant ascetic religiosity.  It is especially discernible
in the import of the religious denominations in America.  Although
state and church are separated, still, as late as fifteen or twenty
years ago no banker or physician took up a residence or established
connections without being asked to what religious community he
belonged, and his prospects were good or bad according to the
character of his answer.  Acceptance into a sect was conditioned
upon a strict inquiry into one's ethical conduct.  Membership
in a sect which did not recognize the Jewish distinction between
internal and external moral codes guaranteed one's business honor
and reliability and this in turn guaranteed success.  Hence the
principle &quot;honesty is the best policy&quot; and hence among
Quakers, Baptists, and Methodists the ceaseless repetition of
the proposition based on experience that God would take care of
his own.  The Godless cannot trust each other across the road;
they turn to us when they want to do business; piety is the surest
road to wealth.&quot; This is by no means &quot;cant,&quot; but
a combination of religiosity with consequences which were originally
imknown to it and which were never intended. (367)</P>

<P>It is true that the acquisition of wealth, attributed to piety,
led to a dilemma, in all respects similar to that into which the
medieval monasteries constantly fell; the religious guild led
to wealth, wealth to fall from grace, and this again to the necessity
of re-constitution.  Calvinism sought to avoid this difficulty
through the idea that man was only an administrator of what God
had given him; it condemned enjoyment, yet permitted no flight
from the world but rather regarded working together, with its
rational discipline, as the religious task of the individual.
 Out of this system of thought came our word &quot;calling,&quot;
which is known only to the languages influenced by the Protestant
translations of the Bible. It expresses the value placed upon
rational activity carried on according to the rational capitalistic
principle, as the fulfillment of a God-given task.  Here lay also
in the last analysis the<BR>
basis of the contrast between the Puritans and the Stuarts.  The
ideas of both were capitalistically directed; but in a characteristic
way the Jew was for the Puritan the embodiment of everything repugnant
because he devoted himself to irrational and illegal occupations
such as war loans, tax farming, and leasing of offices, in the
fashion of the court favorite. (367)</P>

<P>This development of the concept of the calling quickly gave
to the modern entrepreneur a fabulously clear conscience and also
industrious workers; he gave to his employees as the wages of
their ascetic devotion to the calling and of co-operation in his
ruthless exploitation of them through capitalism the prospect
of eternal salvation, which in an age when ecclesiastical discipline
took control of the whole of life to an extent inconceivable to
us now, represented a reality quite different from any it has
today.  The Catholic and Lutheran churches also recognized and
practiced ecclesiastical discipline.  But in the Protestant ascetic
communities admission to the Lord's Supper was conditioned on
ethical fitness, which again was identified with business honor,
while into the content of one's faith no one inquired.  Such a
powerful, unconsciously refined organization for the production<BR>
of capitalistic individuals has never existed in any other church
or religion, and in comparison with it what the Renaissance did
for capitalism shrinks into insignificance.  Its practitioners
occupied themselves with technical problems and were experimenters
of the first rank.  From art and mining experimentation was taken
over into science. (367, 368)</P>

<P>The world-view of the Renaissaiace, however, determined the
policy of rulers in a large measure, though it did not transform
the soul of man as did the innovations of the Reformation.  Almost
all the great scientific discoveries of the 16th and even the
beginning of the 17th century were made against the background
of Catholicism.  Copernicus was a Catholic, while Luther and Melanchthon
repudiated his discoveries.  Scientific progress and Protestantism
must not at all be unquestioningly identified.  The Catholic church
has indeed occasionally obstructed scientific progress; but the
ascetic sects of Protestantism have also been disposed to have
nothing to do with science, except in a situation where material
requirements of everyday life were involved.  On the other hand
it is its specific contribution to have placed science in the
service of technology and economics. (368)</P>

<P>The religious root of modern economic humanity is dead, today
the concept of the calling is a caput mortuum in the world.  Ascetic
religiosity has been displaced by a pessimistic though by no means
ascetic view of the world, such as that portrayed in Mandeville's
Fable of the Bees, which teaches that private vices may under
certain conditions be for the good of the public.  With the complete
disappearance of all the remains of the original enormous religious
pathos of the sects, the optimism of the Enlightenment which believed
in the harmony of interests, appeared as the heir of Protestant
asceticism in the field of economic ideas; it guided the hands
of the princes, statesmen, and writers of the later 18th and early
19th century.  Economic ethics arose against the background of
the ascetic ideal; now it has been stripped of its religious import.
 It was possible for the working class to accept its lot as long
as the promise of eternal happiness could be held out to it. 
When this consolation fell away it was inevitable that those strains
and stresses should appear in economic society which since then
have grown so rapidly.  This point had been reached at the end
of the early period of capitalism, at the beginning of the age
of iron, in the 19th century. (369)<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->
