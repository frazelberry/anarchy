<P><I>THE AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATION AND THE PROBLEM OF AGRARIAN
COMMUNISM</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The idea of a primitive agrarian communism at the beginning
of all economic evolution was first suggested by investigations
into the ancient German economic organization, especially by Hanssen
and von Maurer. These men originated the theory of the ancient
German agrarian communism, which became the common property of
scholarship. Analogies from other lands to the ancient German
rural organization led finally to the theory of an agrarian communism
as the uniform beginning of all economic development, the theory
developed especially by E. de Laveleye. Such analogies came from
Russia and from Asia, especially India. Recently, however, a strong
tendeney has set in to assume private property in land and a manorial
type of development for the most ancient periods accessible to
us, whether in Germany or in other economic systems. (3)</P>

<P>If we consider first the German national agricultural organization
as it presents itself to us in the eighteenth century, and go
back from it to older conditions poorly and scantily illuminated
by the sources, we must begin by restricting ourselves to regions
originally settled by the Teutons. Thus we exclude, first, the
previously Slavic region east of the Elbe and Saal; second, the
region formerly Roman, that is, the Rhine region, Hessia, and
South Germany generally south of a line drawn roughly from the
Hessian boundary to the vicinity of Regensburg; and finally, the
region originally settled by Celts, to the left of the Weser.
(3, 4)</P>

<P>The land settlement in this originally German region had the
village form, not that of the isolated farmstead.</P>

<P>Connecting roads between the villages were originally quite
absent as each village was economically independent and had no
need of connections with its neighbors. Even later the roads were
not laid out systematically but were broken by traffic according
to need and disappeared from one year to the next until gradually
in the course of centuries an obligation to maintain them was
established, resting upon the individual holding of land. Thus
the General Staff maps of this region today give the impression
of an irregular network whose knots are the villages. (4,5)</P>

<P>In the sketch, the first or innermost zone contains the dwelling
lots, placed quite irregularly. Zone Two contains the fenced garden
land (Wurt), in as many parts as there were originally dwelling
lots in the village. Zone Three is the arable (see below), and
Zone Four pasture (&quot;Almende&quot;). Each household has the
right to herd an equal number of livestock on the pasture area,
which, however, is not communal but appropriated in fixed shares.
The same is true of the wood (Zone Five) which incidentally does
not uniformly belong to the village; here also the rights to wood
cutting, to bedding, mast, etc., are divided equally among the
inhabitants of the village. House, dwelling lot, and the share
of the individual in the garden land, arable (see below), pasture
and forest, together constitute the hide (German Hufe, cognate
with &quot;have.&quot;) (5) The arable is divided into a number
of parts called fields (Gewanne) ; these again are laid off in
strips which are not always uniform in breadth and are often extremely
narrow. Each peasant of the village possesses one such strip in
each field, so that the shares in the arable are originally equal
in extent. The basis of this division into fields is found in
the effort to have the members of the community share equally
in the various qualities of the land in different locations. The
intermixed holdings which thus arose brought the further advantage
at all the villagers were equally affected by catastrophes such
as hailstorms, and the risks of the individual were reduced. (5)</P>

<P>The division into strips, in contrast with the Roman custom,
where squares predominate, is connected with the peculiarities
of the German plow. The plow is universally, to begin with, a
hoe-like instrument wielding by the hands or drawn by animals
which merely scratches the soil and makes grooves in the surface.
All peoples which did not get beyond this hoe-plow were compelled
to plow the fields back and forth in order to loosen up the soil.
The most suitable division of the surface for this purpose was
the square, as we find it in Italy from Caesar's time on, and
as the general staff maps of the Campagna and the outer boundary
marks between the individual land holdings still show it.In contrast,
the German plow consisted, as far as we can tell, of a knife which
cut the earth vertically, a share which cut it horizontally, and
finally, at the right, a moldboard which turned it over. This
plow made the criss-cross plowing crisscross plowing unnecessary,
and for its use the division into long strips was most appropriate.
The size of the separate strips was usually determined in this
connection, by the amount which an ox could plow in a day without
giving out - hence the German names &quot;Morgen&quot; (English,
&#147;morning&#148; but equivalent to an acre or &quot;Tagwerk&quot;
(English, day&#146;s work). In the course of time these divisions
underwent much confusion, since the plow, with its moldboard on
the right, had a tendency to work over to the left. Hence the
furrows became uneven, and since there were no balks, originally
at least, between the separate strips, only boundary furrows being
drawn, strips of land belonging to another were often plowed up.
The original arrangement would be restored by &quot;field juries&quot;
with the rod or later the so-called spring circle. (5, 6)</P>

<P>As there are no roads between the single allotments, tillage
operations can only be carried on according to a common plan and
at the same time for all. This was normally done according to
the three field system, which is the most general though by no
means oldest type of husbandry in Germany. It&#146;s introduction
must be set back at least to the eighth century, since it is assumed
as a matter of course in a document of the Rhenish monastery of
Lorsch of about the year 770. (6, 7)</P>

<P>The three-field husbandry means that in the first place the
whole arable area is divided into three tracts, of which at any
one time the first is sown to a winter grain and the second to
a summer grain, while the third is left fallow and, at least in
historical time, is manured. Each year the fields are changed
in rotation, so that the one sown with winter grain is the next
year put to summer grain and in the year following left fallow,
and the others correspondingly. There is stall feeding of livestock
in the winter, while in summer they run on the pasture. Under
such a system of husbandry it was impossible for any individual
to use methods different in any way from those of the rest of
the community; he was bound to the group in all his acts. The
reeve of the village determined when sowing and reaping were to
be done, and ordered the parts of the arable which were sown with
grain fenced off from the fallow land. As soon as harvest was
over, the fences were torn down; anyone who had not harvested
on the common harvest day must expect the cattle, which would
be driven on to the stubble, to trample his grain. (7)</P>

<P>The hide belonged to the individual and was hereditary. It
could be a varying size and was different in nearly every village.
Frequently, as a sort of norm, an extent of 40 acres was taken
as the amount of land necessary to support a typical family. The
part of the holding consisting of a dwelling lot and garden land
was subject to free individual use. The house sheltered a family
in the narrow sense of parents and children, often including grown
sons. The share in the arable was also individually appropriated,
while the rest of the cleared land belonged to the community of
hide-men or peasant holders (Hufner), that is, of the members
in full standing or freemen of the village. These included only
those who held title to some share in each of the three fields
of arable. One who had no land or did not have a share in every
field did not count as a hide-man. (7, 8)</P>

<P>To a still larger group than the village belonged the common
&quot;mark&quot; which included wood and waste land and is to
be distinguished from the almend or pasture. This larger group
was made up of several villages. The beginnings and original form
of the mark association (Markgenossenschaft) are lost in obscurity.
In any case it goes back before the political division of the
land into districts by the Carolingians, and yet it is not identical
with the hundred. Within the common mark there existed, joined
in inheritance with a certain farm, a &quot;head official&quot;
of the mark (Obermdrkeramt), an office which had usually been
preempted by the king or feudal lord, and in addition a wood court,
and an assembly of deputies of the hidemen of the villages belonging
to the mark. (8)</P>

<P>Originally there was in theory strict equality among the members
in this economic organization. But such an equality broke down
in consequence of differences in the number of children among
whom the inheritance was divided and there arose alongside the
hide-men half and quarter hide-men. Moreover, the hide-men were
not the only inhabitants of the village. There were in addition
other sections of the population. First, younger sons who did
not succeed to holdings. These were allowed to go and settle on
the outskirts of the holdings on still uncleared land and received
the right of pasture, for a payment in both cases (Hufengeld,
Weidegeld). The father could also give them out of his garden
allotment, land on which to build a house. From the outside came
hand workers and other neighbors who stood without the organization
of associated hide-men Thus there arose a division between the
peasants and other class of village dwellers, called in South
Germany or cottagers (Seldner, Hausler), and in the north &quot;Brinksitzer&quot;
or &quot;Kossaten.&quot; These latter belonged to village only
on the strength of their ownership of a house but had no share
in the arable. However, they could acquire such a share if some
peasant, with the consent of the village reeve or of the overlord
(originally the clan) sold them a part of his share or if the
village leased them a piece of the almend. Such parcels were called
&quot;rolling holdings&quot; (walzende Acker); they were not subject
to the special obligations of the hide holding or to the jurisdiction
of the manorial court, and were freely transferable. On the otherhand
their holders had no share in the rights of the hide-man. The
number of these people of reduced legal status was not small;
it happened that vilIages transformed up to half of their arable
into such rolling holdings. (8,9)</P>

<P>As a result the peasant population became divided into two
strata as regards land ownership, the hide-men with their different
subclasses on the one hand, and on the other those who stood outside
of the hide organization. But there also formed above the hide-men
a special economic stratum who with their land holdings also stood
outside the main village organization. In the beginning of the
German agricultural system, as long as there was unclaimed land
available, an individual farmer could clear land and fence it;
so long as he tilled it, this so-called &#147;Bifang&#148; was
reserved to him; otherwise it reverted to the common mark. Acquisition
of such &#147;bifangs&#148; presupposed considerable possessions
in cattle and slaves and in consequence was ordinarily possible
only for the king, princes, and overlords. In addition to this
procedure, the king would grant land out of the possessions of
marks, the supreme authority over which he had assumed for himself.
But this granting took place under other conditions than the allotment
of hide land. In this case the allotment affected forest area
with definite boundaries, which had first to be rendered tillable,
and was subject to more favorable legal relations by being free
from the open field obligations. In measuring off these grants
a definite area came into use called the royal hide, a rectangle
of 40 or 50 hectares (1 hectare = 2 1/2 acres, nearly). (9, 10)</P>

<P>The old German settlement form with the hide system spread
out beyond the region between the Elbe and the Weser. Countries
into which it made its way include, first, Scandinavia-Norway
as far as Bergen, Sweden up to the river Dalelf, the Danish Islands
and Jutland; second, England, after the invasions of the Anglo-Saxons
and Danes (the open field system) ; third, almost all northern
France, and a large part of Belgium, as far as Brabant, while
North-Belgium, Flanders and a part of Holland belonged to the
realm of the Salic Fraiaks with a different settlement form; fourth,
in south Germany, the region between the Danube and Iller and
Lech, including parts of Baden and Wurtemberg, as well as upper
Bavaria or the region around Munich, especially the vicinity of
Aibling. With German colonization, the old German form of settlement
also spread over the Elbe eastward, though in a somewhat rationalized
form, since the aim of making the country take up the largest
number of settlers led to the establishment of &quot;street villages&#148;
with favorable property institutions and with the greatest possible
freedom of eco&not; nomic life. The house lots lay not in irregular
groups but to the right and left along the village street, each
one with its own allotment or hide, which allotments lay adjoining
each other in long strips: but here also the divisions into fields
and the compulsory common tillage were retained. (10)</P>

<P>With the expansion of the German land settlement system beyond
its original home, notable distinctions arose. This was especially
true in Westphalia, which is divided by the river Weser into regions
sharply distinct as regards the mode of settlement. At the river
the Germanic settlement form stops suddenly and on the left begins
the region of settlement in isolated farmsteads. There is no village
or common (Almend), and mixed holdings occur only to a limited
extent. The separate farms are cut out the common mark which is
originally uncultivated land. By clearing, new field areas are
made which are allotted to the members of the community, called
&quot;Erbexen.&quot; Moreover, by the process of division other
settlers were admitted the mark, corresponding more or less to
the &quot;Kossdten&quot; farther east - craftsmen, small peasants
and laborers who stand in the relation of renters to the erbexen,
or are de&not; mdent upon them as wage workers. The Westphalian
erbex or farmer is in possession of land to the extent on the
rage of 200 acres, a result of the mode of settlement, and in
a much more independent position than a peasant with intermixed
holdings. The individual farmstead system dominates from the Weser
to the Dutch coast and thus embraces the main territory of the
Salic Franks. (10, 11)</P>

<P>In the southeast the German settlement region abuts on that
of Alpine husbandry and on the territory of the South Slavs. The
Alpine husbandry is based entirely on cattle raising and grazing,
and the common pasture or almend is of predominant importance.
All economic regulations are therefore derived from the necessity
of &quot;stooling&quot; (Schatzung, Seyung), that is, the control
of opportunity for sharing the utilization of the pasture by those
entitled to it. Stooling involves division of the pasture into
a number of &#147;strikes&quot; (Stosze), a strike being the amount
of pasture necessary to support one head of stock through the
year. (11)</P>

<P>The economic unit of the South Slavs in Servia, in the Banat
and also in Croatia, is in historical times not the village but
the house community or zadruga, the age of which is a disputed
point. The zadruga is an expanded family living under the leadership
of a male head of the house and including all his descendants,
often with married couples numbering up to forty or eighty persons,
and carrying on economic life on a communistic basis. They do
not indeed ordinarily live under a single roof, but in production
and consumption they act as a single household using the &#147;common
kettle.&quot; (11, 12)</P>

<P>In the southwest the Germanic rural organization came with
the remains of the Roman method of distributing the land, in which
we have the seigniorial estate in the midst of small dependent
establishments of colons. Bavaria, Baden, and Wurtemberg there
came to be a considerable mixture of these two systems, and especially
in the upland and hilly districts the Germanic systems tends to
disappear. There are mixed holdings but on other hand it also
happens that the cleared land of falls into unified sections in
which the possession of a the individual lie in divisions without
there being any effort at equality in sharing or any discoverable
principle of division. The origin of this &quot;hamlet distribution,&quot;
as Meitzen calls it, is uncertain; it may have originated the
granting of land to unfree persons. (12)</P>

<P>The origin of the specifically Germanic agricultural system
is obscure. In the time of the Carolingians it is already present,
but the division of the open field into equal strips is too systematic
to be primitive. Meitzen has shown that it was preceded by another
system, a division into Lagemorgen (&quot;locus acres&quot;).
The Lagemorgen designates that quantity of land, varying widely
according quality of the soil, the &quot;lie&quot; of the field,
distance dwelling lot, etc., around which a peasant could plow
with a yoke of oxen in a forenoon. The Lagemorgen thus forms the
basis of the open field or Gewann, which always shows this irregular
form wherever the old division has survived, in contrast with
the geometrical form given to it by later division into strips
of equal size. (12, 13)</P>

<P>This view rejects the recent attempt of Rietschel to prove
a military origin for the German land and tillage system. According
to this theory, the system developed out of the organization into
&quot;hundreds.&quot; It holds that the hundred was at the same
time a tactical unit and a political grouping of about a hundred
hide-men, whose holdings must have been at least four times as
large as the later community hide. The central figure of the organization
would be available for military service, since they lived on an
income derived from the labor of their serfs and could be spared
from the community. Thus the hide (Hufe), like the later Anglo-Saxon
hyde, was an ideal unit, suitable for carrying the burden of supporting
a full-armed mounted warrior. Out of a hide organization of this
sort, it is argued, grew the community hide by a process of rationalization,
through the division of the holdings of the great hidemen into
four, eight or ten parts. It is decidedly against this theory
that the field divisions of the German hide organization did not
originate by any rational process, but grew out of the Lagemorgen.
On the other hand, there remains the difficulty that in northern
France the hide organization arose only in the territory over
which the Salic Franks extended their conquests, and not in the
territory which belonged to them originally. (13)</P>

<P>The original German settlement form no longer survives. Its
disintegration began rather early, and not as a result of steps
taken by the peasants, who were not in a position to make such
changes, but through interference from above. The peasant very
early fell into a position of dependence upon a political superior
or feudal overlord; as a community hide-man (Volkshufner) he was
weaker in an economic and military sense than the royal hide-man.
After the establishment of permanent peace, the nobility took
increasing interest in economic affairs. It was the matonagerial
activity of a portion of the nobility which destroyed the rural
organization, especially in south Germany. The imperial abbey
of Kempten, for example, began in the 16th century the so-called
&#147;enclosures&#148; (&quot;Vereinbdungen&quot;) which were
continued into the 18th century. The cleared land was re-distributed
and the peasant placed upon his compacted and enclosed farm (the
so-called Einddhof.) and as nearly as practicable in the center
of it. In north Germany the state set aside the old distribution
of land in the 19th century, in Prussia by the ruthless use of
force., The &quot;Gemeinheitsteilungsordnung&quot; or Decree for
the Division of Communities, of 1821, which was intended to force
the transition to an exchange economy, was issued under the influence
of liberal ideas opposed to mixed holdings, and the common mark,
and pasture. The community with mixed holdings was set aside by
compulsory unification and the common pasture or almend distributed.
Thus the peasant was forced into an individualistic economic life.
In south Germany the authorities were content with the so-called
&quot;purification&quot; of the common field system. To begin
with, a network of roads was laid out between the different field
divisions. As a result many exchanges among individual holdings
looking toward consolidation. The almend remained, but as winter
feeding of stock was introduced, it was extensively transformed
into arable, which served as a source of supplementary income
for individual villagers or as provision for old age. In Baden
especially, this development was characteristic. Here the aim
towards secure provision for the population was persistently dominant
and led to an especially dense settlement. Boundaries on emigration
even had to be granted, and finally in places the situation gave
rise to attempts to separate old settlers and place those later
admitted to rights of common in special almend communities within
the village community. (14, 15)</P>

<P>Many students have seen in the German rural organization the
echo of an original agrarian communism uniformly valid for all
peoples, and have sought elsewhere for examples which would permit
them as far as possible to reason back beyond the German system
to stages no longer historically accessible. In this effort they
have thought to find in the Scotch agricultural system down to
the time of the battle o<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->f Culloden
(1746) - the &quot;runridge system' - a resemblance to the German
system which would permit of inferences as to primitive stages.
It is true that in Scotland the arable was divided into strips,
and holdings intermingled; there was also the common pasture;
thus far there is real resemblance to Germany. But these strips
were redistributed by lot annually or at definite times, so that
a diluted village communism arose. All this was excluded in the
German Lagemorgen, which lies at the basis of the oldest German
field division accessible to us. Along with this arrangement,
and frequently as a part of it, there arose in the Gaelic and
Scotch regions the 'cyvvar,' the custom of communal plowing. Land
which had been in grass for a considerable time was broken up
with a heavy plow drawn by eight oxen. For this purpose the owner
of the oxen and the owner of a heavy plow, generally the village
snlith, came together and plowed as a unit, with one to guide
the plow and one to drive the oxen. The division of the crop took
place either before the harvest or after a joint harvest. (15)</P>

<P>The Scotch system of husbandry was distinguished from the German
by the further fact that the zone of arable was divided into two
sub-zones. Of these the inner was manured and tilled according
to a three-field rotation, while the outer was divided into from
five to seven parts, one of which was put under the plow in any
one year, while the remaining ones were in grass and served as
pasture. The character of this &quot;wild field grass&quot; husbandry
explains the development at the time, of plow associations while
inside the inner zone the individual Scotchman farmed on his own
account like the German peasant. (15, 16)</P>

<P>The Scotch agricultural system is very recent and indicates
a high development of tillage; for the original Celtic system,
we must go to Ireland. Here agriculture was originally based entirely
on cattle raising, due to the fact that, thanks to the climatic
conditions, cattle could remain in the open throughout the year.
The pasture land is allotted to the house community (&quot;tate&quot;)
the head of which ordinarily owns from 300 upward head of stock.
About the year 600, agriculture declined in Ireland and the economic
organization underwent a change. As before, however, the land
was not permanently assigned, but for a lifetime at the longest.
Redistributions were made by the chieftain (tainaist) down as
late as the llth century. (16)</P>

<P>Since the oldest form of Celtic economy of which we know anything
is exclusively connected with cattle raising, little conclusion
can be drawn from it, or from the Scotch cyvvars, in regard to
the primitive stages of Germanic husbandry. The typical German
agricultural system, as known to us, must have originated in a
period when the need for tillage and for stock raising were approximately
equal. Perhaps it was just coming into being at Ceasar's time,
and apparently at Tacitus&#146; time wild field grass husbandry
predominated. However, it is difficult to work with the statements
of either of these Roman writers, of whom Tacitus especially arouses
suspicions by his rhetorical embellishment. (16, 17)</P>

<P>In sharp contrast with the German land system is that of the
Russian mir (opschtschina). This dominated in Great Prussia, but
only in the inner political districts, while it was absent in
the Ukraine and in White Russia. The village of the Russian mir
is a street village, often of remarkable extent, including up
to three or five thousand inhabitants. Garden and field lie behind
the dwelling lot. Newly founded families settle at the end of
the row of allotments. Besides the arable there is utilization
of a common pasture. The arable is divided into fields and these
again into strips. In contrast with the German land system these
are not in Russia rigidly assigned to the single dwelling, but
the allotment takes into account how many mouths or how much labor
force a dwelling musters. According to the number of these, strips
in proportion are assigned, and hence the assignment cannot be
final but only temporary. The law contemplated a twelve year interval
of redivision but in fact it usually took place oftener, every
one, three, or six years. The right to the land (nadyel) pertained
to the individual soul and related not to the house community
but to the village. It was perpetual; even the factory worker
whose forefathers had emigrated from the mir generations before
might come back and assert the right. Conversely, no one could
leave the community without its consent. The nadyel found expression
in the right to a periodical redivision. However, the equality
of all members of the village usually existed on paper only, as
the majority required for a redistribution was almost never obtainable.
In favor of redivision was every family which had increased in
a large ratio; but there were other interests arrayed against
them. The decision of the mir was only nominally democratic; in
reality it was often capitalistically determined. In consequence
of the need for provisions the single households were usually
to a varying extent in debt to the village bourgeoisie or &quot;kulaks,&quot;
who held the mass of the propertyless in their power through money
lending. According to whether they were interested in keeping
their debtors poor or allowing them to acquire more land, they
controlled the decision of the village when redivision was in
question. (17, 18)</P>

<P>Concerning the economic workings of the mir there were two
opinions down to the dissolution of the system in Russia. One
view saw in it, as contrasted with an individualistic rural organization,
the salvation of economic life. It regarded the right of each
emigrant worker to return to the village and demand his portion
as the solution of the social question. Holders of this view admitted
that obstacles were opposed to progress in agricultural methods,
and otherwise, but asserted that the right of the nadyel compelled
the inclusion of everyone in an advance. Their opponents regarded
the mir as a hindrance to progress unconditionally, and the strongest
support of reactionary czaristic policies. (18)</P>

<P>The threatening growth in power of the social revolutionaries
at the beginning of the 20th century led to the destruction of
the mir. In his agrarian reform legislation of 1906-07, Stolypin
gave the peasants the right to withdraw from the mir under specified
conditions and to demand that their portion be granted them free
from liability to later re-apportionment. The share of a withdrawing
member had to be in unified form, a single piece of land, so that,
similar in principle to the enclosures of Allgau, the farmers
were scattered, each individual being placed in the midst of his
holding to carry on individually. Thus came to pass the result
which Count Witte as minister had demanded, namely, the destruction
of the mir. The liberal parties had never dared to go so far,
or, like the Cadets, had believed in the possibility of reforming
it. The immediate result of Stolypin's agrarian reform was to
make the more well-to-do peasants, those in possession of considerable
capital, and those who had relatively much land in proportion
to the members of the family, withdraw from the mir, and the Russian
peasantry was split into two halves. One half, a class of wealthy
large farmers, withdrew and went over to a system of individual
farms; the other, much more numerous, which was left behind, already
possessed too little land and found itself robbed of the right
of redistribution and hopelessly given over to the status of a
rural proletariat. The second class hated the first as violators
of the divine law of the mir; the latter was driven over to unconditional
support of the existing regime, and if the World War had not intervened
would have furnished a new support and &quot;cudgel guard&quot;
for czarism. (18, 19)</P>

<P>Russian scholarship is divided in regard to the origin of the
mir. According to the most generally accepted view, however, it
was not a primitive institution but a product of the taxation
system and of serfdom. Until 1907 the individual member of the
mir not only held against the village his nadyel right, but the
village reciprocally held an unquestionable claim to his labor
power. Even when he had gone away with the permission of the headman
of the village, and taken up an entirely different calling, the
village could call him back at any time to impose upon him his
share of the common burdens. These burdens arose especially in
connection with the amortization of the demnity for the release
from serfdom and the purchase price of freedom from taxation.
On good land the peasant could obtain a surplus above the share
of these burdens falling to him; consequently the town laborer
not infrequently found it to his interest to return unsolicited
to the village, and the mir often paid, in such cases, an indemnity
for relinquishment of the nadyel. But where taxes were too high
and indicated a possibility of higher earnings elsewhere, the
tax burden was increased for those who remained behind, since
it was a joint obligation. In this case the mir would force its
members to return and take up their life as peasants. Consequently,
the solidarity limited the individual member's freedom of movement
and amounted merely to a continuation through the mir of the serfdom
which had been abolished; the peasant was no longer a serf of
the lord but a serf of the mir. (19, 20)</P>

<P>Russian serfdom was unusually harsh. The peasants were subject
to torture; an inspector every year joined pairs of marriageable
age together and outfitted them with land. In relation to the
overlord there were only traditional rights, no enforceable law;
he could undo the arrangement at any time. In the period of serfdom
the redivision was carried out, either, in the case of poor land,
according to the number of workers in the individual peasant's
household, or in the case of good land, according to the number
of mouths. The obligation to the land dominated over the right
to the land, while in the one case as in the other the community
was held jointly for the payments to the overlord. At the same
time the Russian manor exploited the peasants down to the present
day to the extent that the overlords furnished almost nothing,
but tilled the land with the capital and horses of the peasant.
The land was either leased to the peasants or tilled under the
direction of the lord's bailiff with forced labor by the peasants
and their teams. (20)</P>

<P>Joint liability to the overlord, and serfdom, have existed
only since the 16th and 17th centuries. Out of them developed
the custom of redividing the land. The custom of redivision did
not arise in the Ukraine and those parts of Russia, especially
in the west, which were not brought under Muscovite domination
in the 16th and 17th centuries. Here the land was permanently
assigned to the separate dwellings. (20, 21)</P>

<P>On the same principle of joint liability was based the economic
system followed by the Dutch East India Company in their possessions.
The company made the Desa or community jointly responsible for
the dues of rice and tobacco. This joint liability led to the
result that the community would finally compel the individual
to remain in the village to help pay th taxes. With the abandonment
of joint liability in the 19th century, the community with compulsory
membership was also allowed to decline. (21)</P>

<P>The economic system included two methods of rice culture, the
dry culture (tegal) which was relatively unproductive, and wet
culture (sawah) under which the field was surrounded with dykes
and sub-divided within to control the running off of the water
collected for the purpose. One who had established a sawah held
an hereditary inalienable property right to it. The tegal land
was subject to a nomadic husbandry similar to the wild field grass
economy of the outer zone in the Scotch village community. The
village cleared in common while the individual tilled and harvested
singly. The cleared land was cropped from three to four years
and then had to be put to grass while the village moved and broke
up new land. The older conditions make it clear that only the
ruthless and exploitative system of the Dutch East India Company
brought about the system of redistribution. (21)</P>

<P>The system introduced by the company gave place in the thirties
of the last century to that of Kultur-stelsel. Under this system
the individual had to cultivate one fifth of his land for the
benefit of the state, in which connection also the crop to be
grown was prescribed. This system in turn disappeared in the course
of the 19th century, giving place to a more rational mode of husbandry.
(21, 22)</P>

<P>A similar system once obtained for a time in China, according
to the reports of the Chinese classical writers. The arable land
was divided into tracts of nine squares each, of which the outer
squares were assigned to individual families, the inner ones being
reserved for the emperor. The family received the land only for
use at the death of the head of the house, redivision was carried
out. This system was of only passing significance and dominated
only in the neighborhood of large rivers where rice culture by
flooding was possible. In this case also, the communistic organization
of agriculture was dictated by fiscal considerations and did not
arise out of primitive conditions. The original Chinese economic
organization is found instead in the clan economy still common
in the Chinese villages, where the clan has its little ancestral
temple and its school and carries on tillage and economic life
in common. (22)</P>

<P>The last example of a supposed communistic agricultural system
is that of India. Two different forms of village organizations
are met with. Common to the two is the common pasture and a garden
area corresponding to the tract of arable on which in the German
system wage laborers and cottagers lived. Here are settled craftsmen,
temple priests, (which in contrast with the Brahmins play only
a subordinate role), barbers, laundryman, and all kinds of laborers
belonging to the village-the village &quot;establishment.&quot;
They hold on a &quot;demiurgic&quot; basis; that is, they are
not paid for their work in detail but stand at the service of
the community in return for a share in the land or in the harvest.,
The villages differ in regard to land ownership. In the ryotvari
village the land ownership is individual and the tax burden likewise.
At the head of the village is a reeve. The peasants have no share
in the common mark, which belongs to the king (rajah). One who
wishes to clear land must pay for the privilege. (22, 23)</P>

<P>Another type is represented by the village placed under a &quot;joint
body,&quot; a community of a number of privileged nobles, a village
aristocracy of full free-holders or hidemen without an individual
head. These farmers (&quot;Erbexen&quot;) grant out the land and
to them belongs the common mark; thus they stand between the true
cultivators and the rajah. Within this category two classes of
villages may be further distinguished: One is the pattidari village,
where the land is definitively divided out and appropriated. On
the death of the occupant his share goes to his descendants by
blood and is redivided when it again passes by inheritance. The
other is the bhayachara village. Here the land is distributed
in accordance with the labor force or the rank of the individual
holders. Finally, there are also villages in which an individual
is in complete control as tax farmer and overlord. These are zamindari
villages, and the pattidari villages also developed through the
partition of feudal holdings. The special feature of Indian conditions
is that a large number of rent collectors have intervened between
the sovereign and the peasantry through the farming out and re-farming
of the taxes. Frequently a chain of four or five rent receivers
will have originated in this way. Within this group of rent receivers
and large farmers a nominal communism has been evolved. Where
several peasants carry on a communistic husbandry they divide
the harvest, not the land, and the rent is apportioned among the
owners entitled to share. Thus, this case of agrarian communism
also traces its origin to fiscal considerations. (23)</P>

<P>In Germany, again, students thought to find in the holdings
called &quot;Gehoferschaften&quot; of the Moselle the remains
of a primitive agrarian communism, until Lamprecht recognized
their true character. Down to the present these holdings have
consisted chiefly of woodland, but they formerly contained also
meadow and arable which were divided out after the manner of common
fields, periodically and by lot. This arrangement is not primitive,
but arose out of seigniorial policies. Originally the Gehoferschaft
was a manorial farm or estate which was tilled by the labor of
small peasants, members of the mark community. But when the overlords
became knights and were no longer in a position to direct operations
personally, they found it more advantageous to enlist the self-interest
of the peasants, and granted them the land on the terms of a fixed
rent. Here again we meet with the principle of joint obligation.
The mark organization either undertook a definitive division of
the interests, or redistributed periodically by lot. (23, 24)</P>

<P>Not all of these examples serve to prove the thesis of Laveleye
that at the beginning of the evolution agrarian communism existed
in the sense of communistic husbandry, and not merely that of
joint ownership of the soil - two things which must be carefully
distinguished. This is not the case since, in fact, husbandry
was not originally communal. Here there is a sharp conflict in
viewpoint. While the socialistic authors view property as a fall
from grace into sin, the liberals carry it back wherever possible
to the time of the putative ancestors of the population. In reality,
nothing definite can be said in general terms about the economic
life of primitive man. If we seek an answer in the relations of
populations untouched by European influences, we find no unanimity
but ever the sharpest contrasts. (24)</P>

<P>In primitive agricultural life, the so-called hoe-culture predominates.
Neither plow nor beasts of burden are used; the implement of tillage
is a pointed stick, with which the man goes about over the land
and makes holes in which the woman drops the seed. With this method,
however, quite different forms of organization may be associated.
Among the Guatoes in the interior of Brazil, individual economy
is found with no reason for assuming the previous existence of
any other organization. Every household is self-sufficient, without
specialized division of labor among them, and with limited specialization
among the members of the household, and also with limited exchange
relations between tribes. The opposite extreme is the assembly
of work in a large central dwelling, as in the long-house of the
Iroquois. Here the women are herded together under the leadership
of a head woman who apportions the work, and likewise the product,
among the separate families. The man is warrior and hunter, and
undertakes in addition the heavy tasks, clearing the land, building,
the house, and finally herding the cattle. The latter counted
originally as an exalted occupation because the taming required
strength and skill. Later, the esteem in which it is held is traditional
and conventional. We find similar conditions in all parts of the
earth, especially among negro tribes; everywhere among these the
field work falls to the women. (24, 25)
