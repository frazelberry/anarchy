  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Many of the especially notable uniformities in the course
  of social action are not determined by orientation to any sort
  of norm which is held to be valid, nor do they rest on custom,
  but entirely on the fact that the corresponding type of social
  action is in the nature of the case best adapted to the normal
  interests of the actors as they themselves are aware of them.
  This is above all true of economic action, for example, by the
  uniformities of price determination in a 'free' market, but is
  by no means confined to such cases. The dealers in a market thus
  treat their own actions as means for obtaining the satisfaction
  of the ends defined by what they realise to be their own typical
  economic interests, and similarly treat as conditions the corresponding
  typical expectations as the prospective behavior of others. The
  more strictly rational their action is, the more will they tend
  to react similarly to the same situation. In this way there arise
  similarities, uniformities, and continuities in their attitudes
  and actions which are often far more stable than they would be
  if action oriented to a system of norms and duties which were
  considered binding on the members of a group. This phenomenon
  the fact that orientation to the situation in terms of the pure
  self-interest of the individual and of the others to whom he
  is related can bring about results which are very similar to
  those which an authoritarian agency, very often in vain, has
  attempted to obtain by coercion - has aroused a lively interest,
  especially in economic affairs. Observation of this has, in fact,
  been one of the important sources of economics as a science.
  But it is true in all other spheres of action as well. This type,
  with its clarity of self-consciousness and freedom from subjective
  scruples, is the polar antithesis of every sort of unthinking
  acquiescence in customary ways, as well as, on the other hand,
  of devotion to norms consciously accepted as absolute values.
  One of the most important aspects of the process of 'rationalization'
  of action is the substitution for the unthinking acceptance of
  action custom, of deliberate adaptation to situations in terms
  of self-interests. To be sure, this process by no means exhausts
  the concept of rationalization of action. For in addition this
  can proceed in a variety of other directions; positively in that
  of a conscious rationalization of ultimate values; or negatively,
  at the expense not only of custom, but of emotional values; and,
  finally, in favour of a morally skeptical type of rationality,
  at the expense of any belief in absolute values. ... (Weber,
  1947; 122, 123)</P>
  <P>A social relationship will be referred to as 'conflict' in
  so far as action within it is oriented intentionally to carrying
  out the actor's own will against the resistance of the other
  party or parties. The term 'peaceful' conflict will be applied
  to cases in which actual physical violence is not employed. A
  peaceful conflict is 'competition' in so far as it consists in
  a formally peaceful attempt to attain control over opportunities
  and advantages which are also desired by others. A competitive
  process is 'regulated' competition to the extent that its ends
  and means are oriented to an order. The struggle, often latent,
  which takes place between human individuals or types of social
  status, for advantages and for survival, but without a meaningful
  mutual orientation in terms of conflict, will be called ,selection'.
  In so far as it is a matter of the relative opportunities of
  individuals during their own lifetime, it is 'social selection';
  in so far as it concerns differential chances for the survival
  of inherited characteristics, 'biological selection.' (Weber,
  1947; 132, 133)</P>
  <P>All typical struggles and modes of competition which take
  place on aL large scale will lead, in the long run, despite the
  decisive importance in many individual cases of accidental factors
  and luck, to a selection of those who have in the higher degree,
  on the average, possessed the personal qualities important to
  success. What qualities are important depends on the conditions
  in which the conflict or competition takes place. ... Among the
  decisive conditions, it must not be forgotten, belong the systems
  of order, to which the behaviour of the parties is oriented,
  whether traditionally, as a matter of rationally disinterested
  loyalty, or of expediency. Each type of order influences opportunities
  in the process of social selection differently. (Weber, 1947;
  133, 134)</P>
  <P>A social relationship will be called 'communal' if and so
  far as the orientation of social action - whether in the individual
  case, on the average, or in the pure type - is based on a subjective
  feeling of the parties, whether effectual or traditional, that
  they belong together. A social relationship will, on the other
  hand, be called 'associative' if and in so far as the orientation
  of social action within it rests on a rationally motivated basis
  of rational judgement be it absolute values or reasons of expediency.
  ...<BR>
  The purest cases of associative relationships are: (a) rational
  free market exchange, which constitutes a compromise of opposed
  by complementary interests; (b) the pure voluntary association
  based on self-interest... (c) the voluntary association of individuals
  motivated by an adherence to a set of common absolute values...
  (Weber, 1947; 136)</P>
  <P>The communal type of relationship is, according to the usual
  interpretation of its subjective meaning, the most radical antithesis
  of conflict. This should not, however, be allowed to obscure
  the fact that coercion of all sorts is a very common thing in
  even the most intimate of such communal relationships if one
  party is weaker in character than the other. Furthermore, a process
  of the selection of types leading to differences in opportunity
  and survival, goes on within these relationships just the same
  as anywhere else. Associative relationships, on the other hand,
  very often consist only in compromises between rival interests
  .... Hence, outside the area of compromise, the conflict of interests,
  with its attendant competition for supremacy, remains unchanged.
  (Weber, 1947; 137, 138)</P>
  <P>The principal motives for closure of a relationship are: (a)
  the maintenance of quality, which is often combined with the
  interest in prestige and the consequent opportunities to enjoy
  honour, and even profit. ... (b) orientation to the scarcity
  of advantages in their bearing on consumption needs. Examples
  are monopolies of consumption, the most developed form of which
  is a self-subsistent village community; (c) orientation to the
  scarcity of opportunities for acquisition. ... (Weber, 1947;
  143)</P>
  <P>The order which governs a social relationship by tradition
  or by virtue of its legal establishment, may determine that certain
  types of action of some of the parties to the relationship will
  have consequences which affect the others. It may be that all
  are held responsible for the action of any one. In that case
  they will be spoken of as 'solidary' members. Or, on the other
  hand, the action of certain members, the 'representatives', may
  be binding upon the others. ... (Weber, 1947; 143)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor438977"></A>The term 'formal rationality of
  economic action' will be used to designate the extent of quantitative
  calculation or accounting which is technically possible and which
  is actually applied. The 'substantive rationality', on the other
  hand, is the degree in which a given group of persons, no matter
  how it is delimited, is or could be adequately provided with
  goods by means of an economically oriented course of social action.
  This course of action will be interpreted in terms of a given
  set of ultimate values no matter what they may be. ...<BR>
  A system of economic activity will be called 'formally' rational
  according to the degree in which the provision for needs. which
  is essential to every rational economy, is capable of being expressed
  in numerical, calculable terms, and is so expressed. ...<BR>
  On the other hand, the concept of substantive rationality is
  full of difficulties. It conveys only one element common to all
  the possible empirical situations; namely, that it is not sufficient
  to consider only the purely formal fact that calculations are
  being made on grounds of expediency by the methods which are,
  among those available, technically the most nearly adequate.
  In addition, it is necessary to take account of the fact that
  economic activity is oriented to ultimate ends of some kind,
  whether they be ethical, political, utilitarian, hedonistic,
  the attainment of social distinction, of social equality, or
  of anything else. Substantive rationality cannot be measured
  in terms of formal calculation alone, but also involves a relation
  to the absolute values or- to the content of the particular given
  ends to which it is oriented. ... (Weber, 1947; 184, 185)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor434499"></A>There is a form of monetary accounting
  which is peculiar to ration-Al economic profit-making; namely,
  'capital accounting'. Capital accounting is the valuation and
  verification of opportunities for profit and of the success of
  profit-making activity. It involves the valuation of the total
  assets of the enterprise, whether these consist in goods in kind
  or in money, at the beginning of a period of activity; and the
  comparison of this with a. similar valuation of the assets still
  present or newly acquired, at the end of the process. ... A profit-making
  'enterprise' is a system of action capable of autonomous orientation
  to capital accounting. ... (Weber, 1947; 191, 192)</P>
  <P>As distinguished from the calculation appropriate to a budgetary
  unit, the capital accounting and calculation of the market entrepreneur,
  are oriented not to marginal utility, but to profitability. ...
  (Weber, 1947; 193)</P>
  <P>... In particular, rational money accounting presupposes the
  existence of effective prices and not merely of fictitious prices
  conventionally employed for technical accounting purposes. These,
  in turn, presuppose money which functions as an effective circulating
  medium of exchange and in demand as such, and not merely as a
  technical accounting unit. ... Production is, to be sure, in
  formal terms a rational process of want satisfaction. But it
  does not respond to actual wants unless their possessors are
  in a position to make them effective by sufficient purchasing
  power on the market. (Weber, 1947; 194, 195)</P>
  <P>It is thus clear that the formal rationality of money calculation
  is dependent on certain quite specific substantive conditions.
  Those which are of a particular sociological importance for present
  purposes are the following: (1) Market competition of economic
  units which are at least relatively autonomous. Money prices
  are the product of conflicts of interest and compromises; they
  thus result from systems of power relationships. Money, even
  as a unit of account, is essentially significant as a means of
  quantitative expression of estimated opportunities and risks
  met in the pursuit of competitive advantages; (2) money accounting
  attains the highest degree of rationality as a means of orientation
  of economic action by calculation when it takes the form of capital
  accounting. This implies the substantive condition of far-reaching
  market freedom in the sense both of the absence of monopolistic
  limitations which are imposed or are economically irrational,
  and of those which are voluntary and economically rational through
  orientation to the securing of market advantages. ... Capital
  accounting is further dependent on the social conditions of a
  disciplined organization and the appropriation of the means of
  production. This implies the existence of a system of imperatively
  coordinated relationships; (3) it is not wants as such, but effective
  demand for utilities, which regulated the production of goods
  by profit-making enterprises oriented to capital accounting.
  What is to be produced is thus determined by the structure of
  marginal utilities in the income group which has both the inclination
  and the resources to purchase a given utility. This will depend
  on the distribution of wealth in a particular society. Where
  complete market freedom is given. the highest degree of formal
  rationality in capital accounting is absolutely indifferent to
  all the substantive considerations involved. But i is precisely</P>
  <P>enterprise, whether these consist in goods in kind or in money,
  at the beginning of a period of activity; and the comparison
  of this with a similar valuation of the assets still present
  or newly acquired, at the end of the process. ... A profit-making
  'enterprise' is a system of action capable of autonomous orientation
  to capital accounting. ... (Weber, 1947; 191, 192)</P>
  <P>As distinguished from the calculation appropriate to a budgetary
  unit, the capital accounting and calculation of the market entrepreneur,
  are oriented not to marginal utility, but to profitability. ...
  (Weber, 1947; 193)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor540239"></A>... In particular, rational money
  accounting presupposes the existence of effective prices and
  not merely of fictitious prices conventionally employed for technical
  accounting purposes. These, in turn, presuppose money which functions
  as an effective circulating medium of exchange and in demand
  as such, and not merely as a technical accounting unit. ... Production
  is, to be sure, in formal terms rational process of want satisfaction.
  But it does not respond to actual wants unless their possessors
  are in a position to make them effective by sufficient purchasing
  power on the market. (Weber, 1947; 194, 195)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor444198"></A>It is thus clear that the formal
  rationality of money calculation is dependent on certain quite
  specific substantive conditions. Those which are of a. particular
  sociological importance for present purposes are the following:
  (1) Market competition of economic units which are at least relatively
  autonomous. Money prices are the product of conflicts of interest
  and compromises; they thus result from systems of power relationships.
  (Italics mine)&#133; Money, even as a unit of account, is essentially
  significant as a means of quantitative expression of estimated
  opportunities and risks met in the pursuit of competitive Advantages
  (2) money accounting attains the highest degree of rationality
  as a means of orientation of economic action by calculation when
  it takes the form of capital accounting. This implies the substantive
  condition of far-reaching market freedom in the sense both of
  the absence of monopolistic limitations which are imposed or
  are economically irrational, and of those which are voluntary
  and economically rational through orientation to the securing
  of market advantages. ... Capital accounting is further dependent
  on the social conditions of a. disciplined organization and the

  of a system of imperatively coordinated relationships; (3) it
  is not wants as such, but effective demand for utilities, which
  regulated the production of goods by profit-making enterprises
  oriented to capital accounting What is to be produced is thus
  determined by the structure of marginal utilities in the income
  group which has both the inclination and the resources to purchase
  a given utility. This will depend on the distribution of wealth
  in the particular society. (Italics mine) Where complete market
  freedom is given, the highest degree of formal rationality in
  capital accounting is absolutely indifferent to all the substantive
  considerations involved. But it is precisely the existence of
  these substantive factors underlying monetary calculations which
  determine a fundamental limitation on its rationality. (Italics
  mine)... (Weber, 1947; 211, 212)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor545139"></A>... When, in a planned economy,
  the prospect of individual income is used as a means of stimulating
  self-interest, the type and direction of the action thus rewarded
  is heteronomously determined. It is possible for the same thing
  to be true of a market economy, though in a formally voluntary
  way. This is particularly true where the unequal distribution
  of wealth, and particularly capital goods, forces the low-income
  group to comply with the authority of others in order to obtain
  any return at all for the utilities they can offer in the market.
  It may be they are subjected to the authority of a wealthy householder
  or to that of the owners of capital interested in maximizing
  the profit from it, or of their agents. In a purely capitalistic
  organization of production, this is the fate of the entire working
  class. (Weber, 1947; 213)</P>
  <P>From a technical point of view, the division of labour may
  take the following forms: in the first place, it may vary according
  to modes of differentiation and combination of work services
  as such: (1) They may vary according to the type of functions
  undertaken by the same person. He may combine managerial functions
  with those of carrying out specifications; or his work may be
  specialized in terms of one or the other. (Weber, 1947; 213)</P>
  <P>The case where there is little division of labour because
  of the low technical level is typical of primitive household
  economies. ... (Weber, 1947; 225)</P>
  <P>(2) The differentiation and combination of different functions
  may further vary according to the modes in which the services
  of a plurality of persons are combined to achieve a coordinated
  result. There are two main possibilities: First, the .accumulation'
  of functions; that is the employment of a number of persons all
  performing the same function to achieve a result. This may be
  organized in such a way that the functions are coordinated by
  technically independent of each other, are thus parallel ; or
  they may be or organized on a technical basis in relation to
  a single common purpose. (Weber, 1947; 226)</P>
  <P>The division of labour varies also, from a technical point
  of view, in terms of the extent and nature of combinations with
  the non-human means of production. (Weber, 1947; 227)</P>
  <P>&#133; 'Tools' are those aids to labour, the design of which
  is adapted to the physiological and psychological conditions
  of manual labour. 'Apparatus' is something which is 'tended'
  by the worker. 'Machines' are mechanized apparatus. (Weber, 1947;
  227, 228)</P>
  <P>From the social point of view, types of the division of labour
  may be classified in the following way: In the first place, there
  is the question of the ways in which qualitatively different,
  especially complementary functions, are divided between more
  or less autocephalous and autonomous economic units, which may
  further be distinguished economically according to whether they
  are budgetary units or profit-making enterprises. There are two
  polar possibilities:<BR>
  (1) A 'unitary' economy where the specialization of functions
  is wholly internal, completely heterocephalous and heteronomous
  and carried out on a purely technical basis. The same would be
  true of the co-ordination of function. A unity economy may, from
  an economic point of view, be either a budgetary unit or a profit-making
  enterprise.<BR>
  On the largest possible scale a communistic organization of a
  national economy would be a unitary budgetary economy. On the
  smallest scale an example is the primitive family unit .... (2)
  the differentiation of functions may, on the other hand, exist
  as between autocephalous economic units. (a) It may consist in
  the specialization or specification of functions between units
  which are heteronomous, but are autocephalous, which are thus
  oriented to an order established by agreement, or imposed. The
  order, in turn, may be substantively oriented in a variety of
  ways. Its main concern may be to provide for the needs of a superior
  economic unit, which may be the budgetary unit of a lord, an
  oikos, or a profit-making enterprise controlled by a political
  body. The order may, on the other hand, be concerned with providing
  for the needs of the members of some organized group. From an
  economic point of view, this may be accomplished by the organization
  of subsidiary budgetary units, or of profit-making enterprises.
  ... (b) The other main type is the specialization of autocephalous
  and autonomous units in a market economy, which are oriented
  on the one hand substantively only to their own self-interests,
  formally only to the order of a corporate group, such as the
  laissez-faire state, which enforces only formal, rather than
  substantive rules. (Weber, 1947; 228, 229)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor550224"></A>The expropriation of workers in
  general from possession of the means of production depends on
  the following principal economic factors: (a) The fact that,
  other things being equal, it is generally possible to achieve
  a higher level of technical efficiency if the management has
  extensive control over the selection and the modes of use of
  workers, as compared with the situation created by the appropriation
  of jobs or the existence of rights to participate in management.
  These latter conditions produce technically, as well as economically,
  irrational obstacles to efficiency. ...; (b) in a market economy
  a management which is not hampered by any established rights
  of the workers, and which enjoys unrestricted control over the
  goods and equipment which underlie its borrowings, is in a superior
  credit position. ...; (c) from a historical point of view, the
  expropriation of labour has developed since the sixteenth century
  in an economy characterized by a progressive development of the
  market system, both extensively and intensively, by the sheer
  technical superiority and actual indispensability of a type of
  autocratic management oriented to the particular market situations,
  and by the structure of power relationships in the society. ...
  (Weber, 1947; 246, 247)</P>
  <P>... The upshot of all these considerations is that the maximum
  of formal rationality in capital accounting is possible only
  where the workers are subjected to the authority of business
  management. This is a further specific element of substantive
  irrationality (Italics mine) (He means that the maximum of formal
  rationality in his specific sense can be attained only in a structure
  which is in conflict with certain important values or ideas of
  welfare. -Eds.) in the modern economic order; (e) finally, free
  labour and the complete appropriation of the means of production
  create the most favourable conditions for discipline. (Weber,
  1947; 248)</P>
  <P>The expropriation of all the workers from the means of production
  may have the following effects in practice: (1) That management
  is in the hands of the administrative staff of a. corporate group.
  This would be true very particularly of any rationally organized
  socialistic economy. ...; (2) that the managerial functions are,
  by virtue of their appropriation of the means of production,
  exercised by the owners or by persons they appoint. The appropriation
  of control over the persons exercising managerial authority by
  the interests of ownership may have the following consequences:
  (a) Management by one or more entrepreneurs who are at the same
  time owners-- the immediate appropriation of managerial functions.
  This situation, however, does not exclude the possibility that
  a wide degree of control over the policies of management may
  rest in hands outside the organization, by virtue of their powers
  over credit or financing ... ; (b) the separation of managerial
  functions from appropriated ownership, especially through limitations
  of the functions of owners to the appointment of management and
  to the free appropriation of shares of the profits .... The separation
  of ownership and management is formally rational in the sense
  that ... it permits the selection for managerial posts of the
  persons best qualified from the standpoint of profitability.
  ... (Weber, 1947; 248, 249)</P>
  <P>The structure of occupational differentiation and that of
  opportunities for income and profit are closely related. This
  will be discussed in relation to the problems of social stratification.<BR>
  1. The unfree organization of occupations exist in cases where
  there is compulsory assignment of functions within the organization
  of a royal estate, a state, a feudal manor, or a commune on the
  basis of liturgies or of the oikos type of structure. The free
  type of distribution arises from the successful offer of occupational
  services on the labour market or successful application for free
  'positions'.<BR>
  2. ... the specification of functions was typical of the organization
  of the handicrafts in the Middle Ages; specialization is characteristic
  of the modern form of rational organization. Occupational distribution
  in a market economy consists to a large extent of technically
  irrational specification of functions, rather than of rational
  specification of functions, because it is oriented to the market
  situation and hence to the interest of purchasers and consumers.
  ... <BR>
  3. Cases of autocephalous occupational specialization are the
  independent 'business' of an artisan, a physician, a lawyer,
  or an artist. The factory worker and the government official,
  on the other hand, occupy heterocephalous occupational positions...
  (Weber, 1947; 250, 251)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor554878"></A>There are the following stages
  in the development toward capitalism: (a) Effectual monopolization
  of money capital by entrepreneurs who have used it as a means
  to make advances to labour. Connected with this is the assumption
  of powers of management of the process of production by virtue
  of the extension of credit and of control of the product, in
  spite of the fact that appropriation of the means of production
  has continued formally in the hands of the workers, as in the
  handicrafts and mining; (b) appropriation of the right of marketing
  products on the basis of previous monopolization of knowledge
  of the market and hence of market opportunities and monopolization
  of money capital. ...; (c) the subjective disciplining of workers
  who stood in a dependent relationship in the putting-out system,
  and the supply of raw materials and apparatus by the entrepreneur.
  ...; (d) the development of workshops without a rational specialization
  of labour in the process of production, by means of the appropriation
  by the entrepreneur of all the non-human means of production.
  ...; (e) the final step in the transition to capitalistic organization
  of production is the mechanization of the productive process
  and of transportation and its orientation to capital accounting.
  All the non-human means of production become fixed or working
  capital; all the workers become 'hands'. As a result of the transformation
  of enterprises into associations of security owners, even the
  management itself becomes expropriated and assumes the formal
  status of an official. Even the owner becomes effectively an
  agent for, or unofficial representative of, the suppliers of
  credit, the banks. (Weber, 1947; 258,259)</P>
  <P>'Imperative co-ordination' was defined above as the probability
  that certain specific commands (or all commands) from a given
  source will be obeyed by a given group of persons. It thus does
  not include every mode of exercising 'power' or 'influence' over
  other persons. The motives of obedience to commands in this sense
  can rest on considerations varying over a wide range from case
  to case; all the 4ay from simple habituation to the most purely
  rational calculation of advantage. A criterion of every true
  relation of imperative control, however, is a certain minimum
  of voluntary submission; thus an interest (based on ulterior
  motives or genuine acceptance) in obedience. (Weber, 1947; 324)</P>
  <P>... But these factors, custom and personal advantage, purely
  effectual or ideal motives of solidarity, do not, even taken
  together, form a sufficiently reliable basis for a system of
  imperative co-ordination. In addition there is normally a further
  element, the belief in legitimacy. (Weber, 1947; 325)</P>
  <P>There are three pure types of legitimate authority. The validity
  of their claims to legitimacy may be based on: 1. Rational grounds--
  resting on a belief in the 'legality' of patterns of normative
  rules and the right of those elevated to authority under such
  rules to issue commands (legal authority). 2. Traditional grounds--
  resting on an established belief in the sanctity of immemorial
  traditions and the legitimacy of the status of those exercising
  authority under them (traditional authority) ; or finally, 3.
  Charismatic grounds-- resting on devotion to the specific and
  exceptional sanctity, heroism or exemplary character of an individual
  person, and of the normative patterns or order revealed or ordained
  by him (charismatic authority). (Weber, 1947; 328)</P>
  <P>The following may thus be said to be the fundamental categories
  of rational legal authority: - (1) A continuous organization
  of official functions bound by rules. (2) A specified sphere
  of competence. This involves (a) a sphere of obligations to perform
  functions which has been marked off as part of a systematic division
  of labour. (b) The provision of the incumbent with the necessary
  authority to carry out these functions. (c) That the necessary
  means of compulsion are clearly defined and their use is subjective
  to definite conditions. A unit exercising authority which is
  organized in this way will be called an 'administrative organ'.
  (Weber, 1947; 330) (3) The organization of offices follows the
  principle of hierarchy; that is, each lower office is under the
  control and supervision of a higher one. ... (4) The rules which
  regulate the conduct of an office may be technical rules or norms.
  In both cases, if their application is to be fully rational,
  specialized training is necessary. ... (5) In the rational type
  it is a matter of principle that the members of the administrative
  staff should be completely separated from ownership of the means
  of production or administration. ...(Weber, 1947; 331) (6) In
  the rational type case, there is also a complete absence of appropriation
  of his official position by the incumbent. ... (7) Administrative
  acts, decisions, and rules are formulated and recorded in writing,
  even in cases where oral discussion is the rule or is even mandatory.
  ... (8) Legal authority can be exercised in a wide variety of
  different forms .... (Weber, 1947; 332)</P>
  <P>The purest type of exercise of legal authority is that which
  employs a bureaucratic administrative staff. Only the supreme
  chief of the organization occupies his position of authority
  by virtue of appropriation, of election, or of having been designated
  for the succession. But even his authority consist in a sphere
  of legal 'competence. ... (Weber, 1947; 333)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor564992"></A><!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->Experience
  tends universally to show that the purely bureaucratic type of
  administrative organization-- that is, the monocratic variety
  of bureaucracy-- is, from a purely technical point of view, capable
  of attaining the highest degree of efficiency and is in this
  sense formally the most rational known means of carrying out
  imperative control over human beings. It is superior to any other
  form in precision, in stability, in the stringency of its discipline,
  and in its reliability. It thus makes possible a particularly
  high degree of calculability of results for the heads of the
  organization and +or those acting in relation to it. It is finally
  superior both in intensive efficiency and in the scope of its
  operations, and is formally capable of application to all kinds
  of administrative tasks. (Weber, 1947; 337)</P>
  <P>The primary source of the superiority of bureaucratic administration
  lies in the role of technical knowledge which, through the development
  of modern technology and business methods in the production of
  goods, has become completely indispensable.<BR>
  (Weber, 1947; 337)</P>
  <P>Though by no means alone, the capitalistic system has undeniably
  played a major role in the development of bureaucracy. Indeed,
  without it capitalistic production could not continue and any
  rational type of socialism would have simply to take it over
  and increase its importance. Its development, largely under capitalistic
  auspices, has created an urgent need for stable, strict, intensive,
  and calculable administration. It is this need which gives bureaucracy
  a crucial role in our society as the central element in any kind
  of large-scale administration. Only by reversion in every field--
  political, religious, economic, etc. -- to small-scale organization
  would it be possible to any considerable extent to escape its
  influence. ... Conversely, capitalism is the most rational economic
  basis for bureaucratic administration and enables it to develop
  in the most rational form.</P>
  <P>Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally the exercise
  of control on the basis of knowledge. This is the feature of
  it which makes it specifically rational. This consists on the
  one hand in technical knowledge which, by itself, is sufficient
  to ensure it a position of extraordinary power. But in addition
  to this, bureaucratic organizations, or the holders of power
  who make use of them, have the tendency to increase their power
  still further by the knowledge growing out of experience in the
  service. For they acquire through the conduct of office a special
  knowledge of facts and have available a store of documentary
  material peculiar to themselves. ... (Weber, 1947; 339)</P>
  <P>Bureaucracy is superior in knowledge, including both technical
  knowledge and knowledge of the concrete fact within its own sphere
  of interest, which is usually confined to the interests of a
  private business-- a capitalistic enterprise. The capitalistic
  entrepreneur is, in our society, the only type who has been able
  to maintain at least relative immunity from subjection to the
  control of rational bureaucratic knowledge. All the rest of the
  population have tended to be organized in large scale corporate
  groups which are inevitably subject to bureaucratic control.
  ... (Weber, 1947; 339)</P>
  <P>The following are the principal more general social consequences
  of bureaucratic control: - (1) The tendency to 'levelling' in
  the interest of broadest possible basis of recruitment in terms
  of technical competence. (2) The tendency to plutocracy growing
  out of the interest in the greatest possible length of technical
  training. To-day this often lasts up to the age of thirty. (3)
  The dominance of a spirit of formalistic impersonality, 'Sine
  ira et studio', without hatred or passion, and hence without
  affection or enthusiasm. The dominant norms are concepts of straightforward
  duty without regard to personal considerations. ... (Weber, 1947;
  340)</P>
  <P>The most primitive types of traditional authority are the
  cases where a. personal administrative staff of the chief is
  absent. These are 'gerontocracy' and &quot;patriarchalism'.<BR>
  The term 'gerontocracy' is applied to a situation where so far
  as imperative control is exercised in the group at all it is
  in the hands of 'elders'-- which originally was understood literally
  as the eldest in actual years, who are the most familiar with
  the sacred traditions of a group. This is common in groups which
  are not primarily of an economic or kinship character. 'Patriarchalism'
  is the situation where, within a. group, which is usually organized
  on both an economic and a kinship basis, as a household, authority
  is exercised by a particular individual who is designated by
  a definite rule of inheritance. It is not uncommon for gerontacracy
  and patriarchalism to be found side by side. The decisive characteristic
  of both is the conception which is held by those subject to the
  authority of either type that this authority, though its exercise
  is a private prerogative of the person or persons involved, is
  in +act pre-eminently an authority on behalf of the group as
  a whole. It must, therefore, be exercised in the interest of
  the members and is thus not freely appropriated by the incumbent.
  In order that this shall be maintained, it is crucial that in
  both these cases there is a complete absence of an administrative
  staff over-which the individual in authority has personal control.
  he is hence still to --a large extent dependent on the willingness
  of the group members to respect his authority, since he has no
  machinery to enforce it. Those subject to authority are hence
  still members of the group and not &quot;subjects'. But their
  membership exists by tradition and not by virtue of legislation
  or a. deliberate act of adherence. (Weber, 194-fl; 353)</P>
  <P>With the development of a purely personal administrative staff,
  especially a military force under the control of the chief, traditional
  authority tends to develop into 'patrimonialism'. Where absolute
  authority is maximized, it may be called 'Sultanism'.<BR>
  The members are now treated as 'subjects'. An authority of the
  chief which was previously treated principally as exercised on
  behalf of the members, now becomes his personal authority, which
  he appropriates in the same way as he would any ordinary object
  of possession.</P>
  <P>Von Below is quite right in emphasizing strongly that it was
  especially the appropriation of judicial authority which was
  made the basis of special treatment and a source of priviledged
  class status.<BR>
  Where traditional authority is decentralized through the appropriation
  of governing powers by priviledged social groups, this may become
  a formal case of the separation of powers where organized groups
  of the members of such a priviledged class participate in political
  or administrative decisions by a process of compromise with their
  chief.<BR>
  The subjects of such compromises may be rules or concrete administrative
  decisions or measures regulating the administrative process.
  The members of such groups may possibly exercise imperative control
  on their own authority and by means of their own administrative
  staff. (Weber, 1?47- 353)</P>
  <P>The primary effect of traditional authority on modes of economic
  activity is usually in a very general way to strengthen traditional
  attitudes. ... (Weber, 1?47; 354)</P>
  <P>Beyond this, the consequences for the economic order are in
  the first instance a function of the mode in which the group
  exercising imperative authority is financed. ...<BR>
  An oikos maintained by the chief where needs are met on a liturgical
  basis wholly or primarily in kind in the form of contributions
  of goods and compulsory services. In this case, economic relationships
  tend to be strictly bound to tradition. The development of markets
  is obstructed, the use of money is primarily oriented to consumption,
  and the development of capitalism is impossible.<BR>
  Provision by the services of socially priviledged groups has
  very similar effects. Though not necessarily to the same extent,
  the development of markets is also limited in this case by the
  fact that ownership exists in kind, is preempted on a nonmonetary
  basis, and purchasing power is correspondingly reduced. Furthermore,
  the productive capacity of individual economic units is to a
  large extent preempted +or the needs of the governing group.<BR>
  Finally, it is possible for patrimonialism to be organized on
  aL monopolistic basis of meeting its needs, partly by profitmaking
  enterprise, partly by fees, and partly by taxes. In this case,
  the development of markets is, according to the type of monopolies
  involved, more or less seriously limited by irrational factors.
  (Weber, 1?47; 354, 355)</P>
  <P>Positively priviledged property classes typically live from
  property income. This may be derived from property rights in
  human beings, as with slaveowners, in land, in mining property,
  in fixed equipment such as plant and apparatus, in ships. and
  as creditors in loan relationships. ... Finally they may live
  on income from securities.<BR>
  Class interests which are negatively priviledged with respect
  to property belong typically to one of the following types: (a)
  They are themselves objects of ownership, that is they are unfree.
  (b) They are 'outcasts' that is 'proletarians' in the sense meant
  in Antiquity. (c) They are debtor classes and, (d) the 'poor'.<BR>
  In between stand the 'middle' classes. This term includes groups
  who have all sorts of property, or of marketable abilities through
  training, who are in a position to draw their support from these
  sources. Some of them may be 'acquisition' classes. Entrepreneurs
  are in this category by virtue of essentially positive privileges;
  proletarians, by virtue of negative privileges. ... (Weber, 1947;
  425)</P>
  <P>Organized activity of class groups is favoured by the following
  circumstances: (a) the possibility of concentrating on opponents
  where the immediate conflict of interests is vital. Thus workers
  organize against management and not against security holders
  who are the ones who really draw income without working. Similarly
  peasants are not apt to organize against landlords. (b) The existence
  of a class status which is typically similar for large masses
  of people. (c) The technical possibility of being easily brought
  together. ... (d) Leadership directed to readily understandable
  goals. Such goals are very generally imposed or at least are
  interpreted by persons, such as intelligentsia, who do not belong
  to the class in question. (Weber, 1947; 427, 428)</BLOCKQUOTE>
