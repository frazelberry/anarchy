<P>Chapter XXII, <I>The Meaning and Presuppostions of Modern Capitalism,
</I>pp 275 - 278</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Capitalism is present wherever the industrial provision for
  the needs of a human group is caried out by the method of enterprise,
  irrespective of what need is involved. More specifically, a rational
  capitalistic establishment is one with capital accounting, that
  is, an establishment which determines its income yielding power
  by calculation according to the methods of modern bookkeeping
  and the striking of a balance. The device of the balance was
  first insisted upon by the Dutch theorist Simon Stevin in the
  year 1698.</P>
  <P>...</P>
  <P>The most general presupposition for the existence of this
  present-day capitalism is that of rational capital accounting
  as the norm for all large industrial undertakings which are concerned
  with provision for everyday wants. Such accounting involves,
  again, first the appropriation of all physical means of production
  -- land, apparatus, machinery, tools, etc. as disposable property
  of autonomous private industrial enterprises. This is a phenomenon
  known only to our time, when the army alone forms a universal
  exception to it. In the second place, it invovles freedom of
  the market, that is, the absence of irrational limitations on
  trading in the market. ... Third, capitalistic accounting presupposes
  rational technology, that is, one reduced to calculation to teh
  largest possible degree, which implies mechanisation. This applies
  to both production and commerce, the outlays for preparing as
  well as moving goods. </P>
  <P>The fourth characteristic is that of calculable law. The capitalistic
  form of industrial organization, if it is to operate rationally,
  must be able to depend upon calculable adjudication and administration.
  Neither in the age of the Greek city-state (polis) nor in the
  patrimonial state of Asia nor in western countries down to the
  Stuarts was this condition fulfilled. The royal &quot;cheap justice&quot;
  with its remissions by royal grace introduced continual disturbances
  into the calculations of economic life. The proposition that
  the Bank of England was suited only to a republic, not to a monarchy,
  referred to above (p 265) was related in this way to the conditions
  of the time. The fifth feature is free labor. Persons must be
  present who are not only legally in the position, but are also
  economically compelled, to sell their labor on the market without
  restriction. It is in contradiction to the essence of capitalism,
  and the development of capitalism is impossible, if such a propertyless
  stratum is absent, a class compelled to sell its labor services
  to live; and it is likewise impossible if only unfree labor is
  at hand. Rational capitalistic calculation is possible only on
  the basis of free labor; only where in consequence of the exitence
  of workers who in the formal sense voluntarily, but actually
  under the compulsion of the whip of hunger, offer themselves,
  the costs of products may be unambiguously determined by agreement
  in advance. The sixth and final condition is the commercialization
  of economic life. By this we mean the general use of commercial
  instruments to represent share rights in enterprise, and also
  in property ownership.</P>
  <P> To sum up, it must be possible to conduct the provision for
  needs exclusively on the basis of market opportunities and the
  calculation of net income. The addition of this commercialization
  to the other characteristics of capitalism involves intensification
  of the significance of another factor not yet mentioned, namely
  speculation. Speculation reaches its full significance only from
  the moment when property takes on the form of negotiable paper.</BLOCKQUOTE>
