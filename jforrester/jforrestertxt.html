<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B>The world system is encountering
new pressures. By &quot;world system&quot; we mean man, his social
systems, his technology, and the natural environment. These interact
to produce growth, change, and stress. It is not new to have great
forces generated from within the socio-technical-natural system.
But only recently has mankind become aware of rising forces that
cannot be resolved by the historical solutions of migration, expansion,
economic growth, and technology. (1)</P>

<P>The manifestations of stress in the world system are excessive
population, rising pollution, and disparity in standards of living.
But are growing population, pollution, and economic inequality
causes or symptoms? Can they be ameliorated directly, or do the
causes of stress lie elsewhere in the world system? (1)</P>

<P>There is a growing awareness that past efforts to relieve stress
in our social systems have often been, in retrospect, only efforts
to suppress symptoms without altering the underlying causes. More
and more, the world system is becoming tightly interrelated. An
action in one sector of the system can produce consequences in
another sector. Often the consequences are unintended and undesirable.
We need to understand the ways in which the major factors are
influencing one another on a world-wide scale if we are to have
confidence that our actions will lead to improvement rather than
to making matters worse. (1)</P>

<P>Our knowledge and assumptions about the components of a system,
even systems as complex as our social systems, can now be interrelated
and examined through methods that have been developed in the last
several decades. Such is done by organizing the individual concepts
into a &quot;model&quot; that reveals the consequences and internal
inconsistencies of our assumptions and fragments of knowledge.
From such an examination can come a much improved understanding
of the world system within which we are enmeshed. (1)</P>

<P>This book sets forth a dynamic model of world scope, a model
which interrelates population, capital investment, geographical
space, natural resources, pollution, and food production. From
these major sectors and their interactions appear to come the
dynamics of change in the world system. Rising population creates
pressures to increase industrialization, grow more food, and occupy
more in land. But more food, material goods, and land tend to
encourage and permit larger populations. The growth in population,
with its attendant industrialization and pollution, comes from
circular processes in which each sector both enhances and feeds
on other sectors. But in time, growth encounters limits set by
nature. Land and natural resources become exhausted, and the pollution-dissipation
capacity of the earth becomes overloaded. (1, 2)</P>

<P>The battle between the forces of growth and the restraints
of nature may be resolved in a number of ways. Man, if he understands
well enough and acts wisely, can choose a path out of the conflict
of world pressures that is more favorable than present actions,
attitudes, and policies portend. Such a path must be toward a
non-growing and balanced condition of the world system. The challenge
is to choose the best available transition from the past dynamics
of growth to a future condition of world equilibrium. (2)</P>

<P>Ever since Malthus stated his propositions relating population
and food some 150 years ago, the validity of his assumption that
food imposes an ultimate limit on population has been debated.
The continued growth of population and the rise in the productivity
of agriculture are often cited to refute Malthus. But it is undeniable
that Malthus stated one ultimate barrier to unending population
expansion. His assertion is not erroneous; it is merely incomplete.
(2)</P>

<P>Food supply may not be the first barrier to restrain rising
population. Other forces within the world's socio-technological
system may suppress further increase in population before starvation
does. (2)</P>

<P>Population, capital investment, pollution, food consumption,
and standard of living have been growing exponentially throughout
recorded history. Man has come to expect growth, to see it as
the natural condition of human behavior, and to equate growth
with &quot;progress.&quot; We speak of the annual percentage growth
in gross national product (GNP) and in population. Quantities
that grow by a fixed percentage per year are exhibiting &quot;exponential&quot;
growth. But exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. (2)</P>

<P>Pure exponential growth possesses the characteristic of behaving
according to a &quot;doubling time.&quot; Each fixed time interval
shows a doubling of the relevant system variable. Exponential
growth is treacherous and misleading. A system variable can continue
through many doubling intervals without seeming to reach significant
size. But then, in one or two more doubling periods, still following
the same law of exponential growth, it suddenly seems to become
overwhelming. The psychological impact of exponential growth is
seldom appreciated. Suppose that some ultimate physical limit
stands in the way of a quantity that is growing exponentially.
In all previous time before the limit is approached the quantity
is much smaller than the limit. The very existence of the limit
may be unrealized. No clash between the growing quantity and the
limit forces attention to the eventual pressures that must arise.
Then suddenly, within one doubling interval, the quantity grows
from half the limit to the limit. The stresses from overexpansion
become highly visible; they can no longer be ignored. If the pressures
created by approach to the limit are not great enough to suppress
growth, then growth continues until the limit has been overstepped
far enough to generate forces sufficient to inhibit growth. (2,
3)</P>

<P>The world system can exhibit many alternative modes of behavior
in response to different policies that man might follow in guiding
population growth, capital investment generation, natural-resource
usage, pollution control, and agricultural output. Figure 1-6
... illustrates one possible future. Here population and capital
investment grow until natural resources decline far enough to
inhibit expansion. As resources decline still further, the world
is unable to sustain the peak population. Population then declines
along with capital investment. Quality of life depends on material
standard of living, food supply, crowding and polllution. Quality
of life in Figure 1-6 falls because of the pressures created by
the shortage of natural resources. ... (9)</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="jf16.JPG" WIDTH="532" HEIGHT="433" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

<P>But the depletion of natural resources may not be the first
and most likely pressure to limit the growth of population. The
world today sems to be entering a condition in which pressures
are rising simultaneously from every one of the influences that
can suppress growth - depeleted resources, pollution, crowding,
and insufficient food. It is still unclear which will dominate
if mankind continues along the present path. The gradual peaking
and decline of population in Figure 1-6 is less traumatic than
other paths into equilibrium that teh world system may exhibit.
(9, 10)</P>

<P>Instead of allowing a limit to growth to be imposed by declining
resources, science may very well find ways to use the more plentiful
metals and to increase our sources of energy so that resource
depletion does not intervene. If so, the way then remains open
for growth until some other pressure arises within the system.
Figure 1-7 shows the result when the resource shortage is foreseen
and avoided. Here the only change from the conditions of Figure
1-6 is the usage rate of natural resources after the year 1970.
In Figure 1-7 after 1970, resources are assumed to be expended
at only 25% of the rate assumed in Figure 1-6. In other words,
to see whether a more desirable future is created, we assume that
technology sustains the standard of living with a lower drain
on the expendable and irreplaceable resources. (10)</P>

<P>But the picture becomes even less attractive. If resources
hold out, Figure 1-7 shows population and capital investment rising
until a population crisis is created. Pollution then acts directly
to reduce birth rate, increase death rate, and to depress food
production. Population, which according to this simple model peaks
at the year 2030, has fallen to one-sixth of its highest level
within an interval of 20 years. Such a plunge would be a world-wide
catastrophe. Should it occur, one can speculate on which sectors
of the world population would suffer most. It is quite possible
that the more industrialized countries, from which the pollution
comes, would be the least able to survive such a disruption to
environment and food supply. They might be the ones to take the
brunt of the collapse. There is now developing a strong undercurrent
of doubt about technology as the savior of mankind. There is a
basis for such doubt. We see in Figure 1-7 how one technological
success (reducing our dependence on natural resources) can merely
save us from fate only to make us the victims of something worse
(a pollution catastrophe). (11)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The following issues are raised by the dynamic behavior shown
by the model of world forces. ...</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. Industrialization may be a more fundamental disturbing
  force in world ecology than is population. In fact, the population
  explosion is perhaps best viewed as a result of technology and
  industrialization. ...</P>
  <P>5. The high standard of living of modern industrial societies
  seems to result from a production of food and material goods
  that has been able to outrun the rising population. But, as agriculture
  reaches a space limit, as industrialization reaches a natural-
  resource limit, and as both reach a pollution limit, population
  tends to catch up. Population then grows until the &quot;quality
  of life&quot; falls far enough to stabilize population.</P>
  <P>6. There may be no realistic hope of the present underdeveloped
  countries reaching the standard of living demonstrated by the
  present industrialized nations. The pollution and natural-resource
  load placed on the world environmental system by each person
  in an advanced country is probably 20 to 50 times greater than
  the load now generated by a person in an underdeveloped country.
  With 4 times as many people in underdeveloped countries as in
  the present developed countries, their rising to the economic
  level that has been set as a standard by the industrialized nations
  could mean an increase of 10 times in the natural- resource and
  pollution load on the world environment. ... In fact, the present
  disparity between the developed and underdeveloped nations may
  be equalized as much by a decline in the developed countries
  as by an improvement in the underdeveloped countries.</P>
  <P>7. A society with a high level of industrialization may be
  non sustainable. It may be self-extinguishing if it exhausts
  its natural resources on which it depends. Or, if unending substitution
  for declining natural resources were possible, a new international
  strife over pollution or environmental rights might pull the
  average world-wide standard of living back to the level of a
  century ago.</P>
  <P>8. From the long view of a hundred years hence, the present
  efforts of underdeveloped countries to industrialize may be unwise.
  They may now be closer to an ultimate equilibrium with the environment
  than are industrialized nations. ... If one of the several forces
  strong enough to cause a collapse in world population does arise,
  the underdeveloped countries might suffer far less than their
  share of the decline because economies with less organization,
  integration, and specialization are probably less vulnerable
  to disruption (11 - 13)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The system as described in Chapters 2 and 3 is discovered to
be one in which growth is reversed by the pressures arising from
declining natural resources. ...</P>

<P>The decline in population is caused ... by falling natural
resources. The falling natural resources lower the effectiveness
of capital investment and lower the material standard of living
enough to reduce population. At about the year 2000, natural resources
are falling steeply. The slope of the curve is such that, if usage
continued at the same rate, natural resources would disappear
by the year 2150.</P>

<P>In section 3.8 the supply of natural resources was assumed
sufficient to last for 250 years at the 1970 rate of usage. But
in Figure 4-1 the rate of usage ... rises another 50% between
1970 and 2000 because of the rising population and the increasing
capital investment. Well before natural resources disappear, their
shortage depresses the world system because of the natural- resources
extraction multiplier ... that introduces the more difficult extraction
task resulting from depleted and more diffuse stocks of resources.
The effect of rising demand and falling supply is to create the
dynamic consequences of shortage, not 250 years in the future,
but only 30 to 50 years hence. (69)</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="jf41.JPG" WIDTH="528" HEIGHT="433" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="1"></CENTER></P>

<P>Quality of life ... peaks around the year 1960. It has declined
very little by the year 1970 and is near its all-time high. Is
this reasonable? How can one explain a historical maximum in quality
of life at a time when the world shows rising social unrest? The
two become consistent if we compare expectations with actuality.
Figure 4-1 shows an extension beyond 1940 of the quality of life
curve prior to that year. The extension continues to rise along
the slope that had characterized the first part of the century.
But the actual curve has fallen away from the extended slope.
(note: increasing at a decreasing rate) (70, 71)</P>

<P>The effect of reducing the demand for natural resources is
to take one layer of restraint off the growth forces of the system.
If natural resources no longer limit growth, the next growth-suppressing
pressure will arise within the system.</P>

<P>Figure 4-5 (See Fig 1-7) shows pollution as the next barrier
to appear ... (75)</P>

<P>The processes of pollution generation were not altered in the
model by the reduced usage rate of natural resources. Some people
argue that pollution is related directly to resource usage, but
that seems only partially justified. A technology that is conserving
rare metals might turn to chemicals and plastics with equivalent
or higher pollution danger.</P>

<P>... Reaction to the pollution crisis depends on its dynamic
nature and on the steps that are necessary to stop it from taking
the course shown in the figure. If ... prevention requires a major
cutback of industrial activity, the treatment will at first seem
as serious as the disease. ... Faced with this dilemma, the most
probable course of action is to wait and to hope that the pollution
threat has been exaggerated. As a consequence of such indecision,
the pollution cycle would continue. (75, 76)</P>

<P>The intuitively obvious &quot;solutions&quot; to social problems
are apt to fall into one of several traps set by the character
of complex systems. First, an attempt to relieve one set of symptoms
may only create a new mode of system behavior that also has unpleasant
consequences. Second, the attempt to produce short-term improvement
often sets the stage for a long-term degradation. Third, the local
goals of a part of the system often conflict with the objectives
of a larger system. Fourth, people are often led to intervene
at points in a system where little leverage exists and where effort
and money have but slight effect. (94)</P>

<P>As to the second characteristic, social systems usually exhibit
fundamental conflict between the short-term and long-term consequences
of a policy change. A policy which produces improvement in the
short run is usually one which degrades the system in the long
run. Short run and long run must be defined in terms of the dynamic
responses in the system of interest. In corporate affairs, short
run might be one to three years and long run beyond five years.
In urban or national issues, short run could be a decade, while
long run might be twenty years or more. In world dynamics, short
run is several decades, and long run is fifty years to several
centuries. Policies and programs which produce long-run improvement
may initially depress the behavior of a system. This is especially
treacherous. The short run is more visible and more compelling.
It speaks loudly for immediate attention. But a series of actions
all aimed at short-term improvement can eventually burden a system
with long-run depressants so severe that even heroic short-run
measures no longer suffice. ... (94)</P>

<P>Increased industrialization, created by a higher rate of capital
investment, may be one of those system interventions that eventually
succeeds only in exchanging one system stress for another ...
(95)</P>

<P>As a result, the pollution crisis reappears. In figure 4-5
the pollution crisis occurred because natural resources were depleted
slowly enough that population and industrialization exceeded the
pollution-absorption capability of the earth. Here in Figure 5-1
the pollution crisis occurs because industrialization is rushed
and reaches the pollution limit before the industrial society
has existed long enough to deplete resources. (96)</P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="jf51.JPG" WIDTH="695" HEIGHT="566" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P>

<P>A number of studies of social systems have resulted in models
that generate life cycles that start with growth and merge into
equilibrium. There are always severe stresses in the transition.
Pressures must rise far enough to suppress the forces that produced
growth. Not only is the world facing the pressures that will stop
population growth, but it also is encountering the pressures that
will stop the rise of both industrialization and the world average
of standard of living. (112)</P>

<P>If growth is to be stopped, the kind of positive-feedback loops
illustrated in Figures 2-2, 2-3, and 2-8 must be deactivated.
Doing this through direct population control alone will almost
certainly fail. Efforts to achieve population stabilization through
birth-control programs probably will not prove to be effective
leverage points in the system. On the other hand, capital investment
and food supply are both within the major growth loops and may
be points of strong influence. (113)</P>

<P>Figures 6-7 and 6-8 mean an end to population growth and to
rising standard of living. They suggest a reversal of the emphasis
on economic development. Reduction of investment rate and reduction
in agricultural productivity are counter intuitive and not likely
to be accepted without extensive system studies and years of argument
- perhaps more years than are available. (120, 121)</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor452973"></A><!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->Impending
changes in the world system threaten modern social values and
goals. The industrialized societies have become geared to a philosophy
of growth and rising standard of living for everyone. This cannot
continue indefinitely. New human purposes must be defined to replace
the quest for economic advancement. Nature must be helped rather
than conquered. Civilization must be restrained rather than expanded.
Social pressures probably must increase rather than decline, until
those pressures can be transformed into a change in social values
that take satisfaction from an equilibrium society.</P>

<P>The underdeveloped countries face equally traumatic changes
in goals. They now aspire to reach the level of industrialization
of the advanced countries. But they may already be in better balance
with the environment than the countries they try to emulate. (125)</P>
