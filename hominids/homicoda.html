    <P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">This is an attempt </FONT><FONT
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">to present an honest, albeit
    limited, view of humankind as noneotherthan you or I, i.e., ordinary
    &quot;us&quot; trying to find our way along with a minimum of
    damage, and maybe a little bit of good.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Humanity has been for
    quite some time &quot;under the gun,&quot; so to speak. Communities
    have become subservient to <B>this</B> warlord to prevent from
    becoming subservient to <B>that</B> warlord. The patriotism and
    glorification of this or that faction - with all its flags and
    banners and shiny things - often decided by which side of the
    river you're from.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Through a history of
    hierarchical evolution, the warlords have become nation-states,
    vested under the ministry of whatever elected or otherwise official.</FONT></TD>
    <TD WIDTH="32%" VALIGN="TOP">
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> At each level in the
    process, a little community is lost; a little more power slips
    away from the average noneother than &quot;us&quot; and winds
    up in the hand with the gun.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> Humanity has really
    not changed that much. But now there's more of it. The gun, too,
    gets bigger. And there are a lot more of them going around.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">How did violence become
    the main thing here? No doubt, it is part of our psyche,  as
    is love and compassion;  we care for our children and parents.
    These are the virtues of community. </FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">So who put violence on
    top? More importantly, how do we get on top of it?</FONT></TD>

    <P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">I wish on
    these webpages to present an undercurrent of history not often
    taught in the schools or thought about much - a history of humanity
    that has formed on the basis of values such as family and community,
    and not as a means to merely conquer and rob. </FONT></TD>
