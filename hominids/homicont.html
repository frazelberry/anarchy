    is familial.</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> This is the fundamental
    bond between two people: the mother and child. The mother conceives
    in her belly. For months she carries another being within her
    own; and for many months thereafter she is totally consumed by
    the demands of this waily-poopy- inarticulate- daily- nuisance.
    Then for many years, she is responsible to it. Regardless of
    unresolved issues and whatever may arise, had she failed in this
    - from the earliest womb to the present - none of us would be
    alive.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">And more than milk was passed between
    them. Harlow's classic research in the 1950's demonstrated that
    without contact - the warm embrace from the adult - the whole
    of the infant's life is wrecked. Having neither mother nor surrogate,
    the experiment bred trembling monkeys who would in no case be
    upwardly mobile. For the sake of these poor monkeys, we should
    recall this conclusion:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
    <B>the foundation of all civilizations - be they hominid or humanoid
    - is familial and the bond that unites it is nothing less than
    motherly love.</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"></FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The core of this civilization is
    female. Mothers were burdened with the task of raising their
    offspring, while the male - typically - were more aloof. The
    causal connection between sex and pregnancy was not obvious nor
    commonly accepted - at least by the guys. <A HREF="../weber/weber27ii.html#anchor318901"
    TARGET="_blank">(Weber, 1927, p 36)</A> And annoyed by the wailing
    and poopy smell, they often retired to fraternal lodging and
    secret societies. Still, they remained within the greater community.
    Why is this? Some of these retro-active ties to community was
    mother- son, but as mothers generally die before sons, the lasting
    tie was brother- sister. Marriage, as a monogomous more-or-less
    permanent institution for father and mother is a relatively late
    development in civilized life. Preceding it was the </FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#ffff91" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;widespread institution
    of the &quot;avunculate&quot; in which her mother's brother is
    the woman's protector and her children inherit from him.&quot;

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Such
    backward bonding has economic bearing</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> - </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">to
    be sure - but its primary impulse is social. According to Karl
    Polyani, the two principle means of economic transfer in primitive
    society are </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">reciprocity</FONT></B><FONT
     COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">and
    </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">redistribution</FONT></B><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">, based upon custom and ceremony. Reciprocity
    works mainly in regard to the sexual organization of society,
    that is, family and kinship; redistribution regards all those
    who are under a common chief and is, therefore, of a territorial
    character.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Reciprocity is a step removed from
    the maternal bond. It is not derived from devotion or love as
    exists at the level of union, but is more in the direction of
    what we would normally call &quot;community.&quot; It is derived
    from </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">conformity</FONT></B><FONT
     COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">which
    is profoundly powerful in all hominid groups.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">It is an interesting exercise to
    calculate how much time we spend each day just trying to define
    ourself to others in a favorable light. We present ourselves
    within the context of a value system, called &quot;norms&quot;.
    By such comformity we expect to receive something in return -
    approval, sex, love, a big raise, etc. - or to avoid punishment
    or loss. Conformity is the external aspect of personality, which
    in itself is a construct - a conceptual self. Conformity is reciprocal:
    others are at the same time conforming to you. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Reciprocal relations between individuals
    are affirmative; they recognize the other's personality, interests
    and rights. They form a bridge between one ego and another, but
    they constitute no unity; they are as far from pure selfishness
    as from a close union.&quot; </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><A

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Secondly,
    as regards redistribution</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">,</FONT><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> one must first acknowledge the extent
    to which noneconomic aims form the core of the community. The
    men's societies have already been established. Its secret societies
    and rites of passage are not economic in the main - again, they
    may have economic effects if, for example, its ceremonial dances
    may deliver rain to the crops. Even so, it follows that if a
    good harvest is produced ceremoniously, its distribution proceeds
    ceremoniously also.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The ceremonial aspect of distribution
    reaches an absurd climax in the </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">potlach</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">
    ceremonies of the natives of Northwest Canada. It began as a
    way of sharing title to wealth with one's community so to allieviate
    conflict. But soon the value of the ceremony became more valuable
    than the wealth itself.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">One may be tempted to scorn such
    displays</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> </FONT><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">as particularly primitive; though they
    are certainly no less rational than the efforts of civilized
    societies to outproduce stockpiles of expensive weaponry designed
    for the annihilation of our planet - together with their radioactive
    residue. Blankets and coins seem comparatively benign.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Moreover, such ceremonies as these
    formed a very cohesive social and economic unit in which the
    individual did not fear starvation - lest he himself ignore his
    own communal obligations - thereby generosity (more than averice
    ostentation) was produced.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Two further rules common to primitive
    communities which facilitate reciprocity and redistribution without

    again from the Trobriand Islands,</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
    </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">each coastal village has as
    &quot;counterpart in an inland village, so that the important
    exchange of breadfruits and fish, though disguised as a reciprocal
    distribution of gifts, and actually disjoint in time, can be
    organized smoothly. In the Kula trade, too, each individual has
    his partner on another isle, thus personalizing to a remarkable

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Centricity</FONT><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> involves the selection of a head tribesman
    to whom the common catch or harvest is offered up. This headman

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We can
    further postulate that from this sexual division</FONT><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> - from prehistory to the present, like
    it or not - civilization and domestic economy evolved by women;
    while men - by their fraternal order - developed tribunals and
    religious rites. Admission to the fraternity for the male child
    was itself a religious process in many communities. The men also
    hunted, domesticated animals, cleared forests and built houses.
    These duties were best done as a group. Finally - reluctantly
    perhaps, as submission to their narrowing familial units as with
    wives and descendents - they became wedded to agriculture and
    thereby responsible for plowing and grazing animals over large
    plots of land, while the women remained supreme in the household
    and garden.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Marriage and paternal obligations
    ultimately domesticated the men - ostensibly also within the
    domain of the women. But outside of the household, including
    the fields and pastures, and fashioning of tools and customs,
    and particularly in the spectrum of war, men retained control.
    <A HREF="../weber/weber27ii.html#anchor104148" TARGET="_blank">(Weber,
    1927)</A></FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Hunting and agriculture require
    a territory in which to hunt and farm. When tecnology is primitive
    - as in primitive communities - one group will quickly exhaust
    its territory and move on. Hence, the nomadic community.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The problem in so doing is that
    one group will eventually find its way into the territory of
    another group. Hence, competing pressures for scarce resources.
    The visited group will feel &quot;invaded&quot; and retaliate.
    In the beginning we might imagine a clumsy form of intimidation,
    using the same tools as for hunting. Later a specialized and
    skilled class of warrior evolved to not only defend one's territory,
    but to extend it to assume the territory and wealth of one's
    neighbors . Whenever one community so commits its resources,
    all other communities must do likewise. So has much of the hominid
    history been written.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Civilization and invasion thus
    arise together. The earliest civilization that we can decipher
    arose in the warm regions of Mesopotania, amidst several wandering
    Semitic tribes, where the technology of agriculture allowed a
    settled and stable life. To the north, however, were the nomadic
    Aryans. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;It
    was inevitable that nomad folk and settled folk would clash.
    and that the nomads should seem hard barbarians to the settled
    peoples, and the settled peoples soft and effeminate and very
    good plunder to the nomad peoples. &quot; (Wells, rev. ed. 1956,
    p. 130) </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The conquering warrior
    would assume the position of authority over the civilized society,
    acquire language and a taste for the arts from them, but maintain
    a warrior distinction, the &quot;shame culture&quot; of nobility,
    whereby in a contest of honor with others of their class, several
    thousand subjects, their subsistence and culture, would be sacrificed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">With
    the shift in economy from work to war</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">,
    the property stucture of the community also shifted from matrilineal
    to patrilineal. A warrior would hire out his services to the
    community, through the chieftan, in exchange for the produce
    of the land rather than the land itself. This could also happen
    as a process of inheritance - the land being passed to the eldest
    son, the other sons would have to hire out anyway. Some would
    go to work making ploughs, for example, for the farmers. Or perhaps,
    they would make spears. Specialization developed among many lines.
    But the force that united community at this time was no longer
    its maternity - but its military.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Chieftans would become lords, and
    lords, warlords. The families that remained on their farms had
    to produce a surplus to feed their defenders - and so became
    <A HREF="../peasants/peasants.htm" TARGET="Frame10833">peasants</A>; which
    is a step above having to provide for their conquerors, who would
    make them slaves. But in either case, their lives were not very
    happy.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Other descendents of
    the community</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> cut off from
    the land but also not cut out to be warriors headed off to market
    to learn and to apply their skills in crafts or trades. Here,
    the village community evolved somewhat independently of the countryside.
    Such communities - as in the cities of today - were conglomerations
    of communities evolving over time sharing a proximity of location,
    exchanging knowledge and beliefs as well as commodities. The
    unifying economy at this time was the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">guild</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, the surrounding territories
    became consolidated by warring factions. A successful military
    power will either leave its lords and assembly in place and merely
    extract tribute in turn from the peasantry; or it will establish
    a colony to dominate natives, or slaves, or their own labor,
    remitting taxation to the homeland.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Through conquest and inheritence,
    then, society is stratified and community lost.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Spiritual
    ceremonies and relations formed the basis of t<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->he
    primitive community</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
    </FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">- and this is still the case
    within cloisters. With the empire, however, arose the empirical
    church, which translated spiritual traditions into an hierarchical
    authority appropriate for its age. The Church preached subjugation
    to the empire of Rome or colonies of Spain. Spirituality became
    elitist. The &quot;lillies of the valley&quot; do not feed a
    family, nor are they acceptable for taxes. For those of us who
    must live within the realm of society, there is confession.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">With the enclosures of feudal lands
    into private properties and a great infusion of precious metals
    as money, the Church was &quot;reformed&quot; and the individual
    &quot;liberated.&quot; Farmers were &quot;liberated&quot; from
    their land and familial obligations, and were forced to sell
    their labor for wages, pay for their land with rents, and acquire
    their product with prices.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">In the next step, humanity is liberated
    from religious principles altogether. The autocephalous unit
    - the individual, or &quot;ego&quot; - orients himself to his
    situation in terms of rational self-interest. Rationality, on
    the one hand, obliterates the reliance on custom and tradition
    and, on the other, places reliance on competition and compromise.
    Society is imputed on the basis of these inherently conflicting
    self-interests; which is to say, humanity is liberated from itself.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Without the legitimacy of symmetry
    and reciprocity, or the equality of redistribution, the modern
    state requires other means for social cohesion. The state is
    organized bureacratically which, says Weber is &quot;the most
    rational known means of carrying out imperative control over
    human beings&quot; (Weber, 1947; p 337).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Groups
    are defined by boundaries<B>,</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">
    limited by social cohesion. Within a city or a classroom, such
    groups form subgroups - e.g., cliques or associations - which
    have their own inner and outer dimensions. Each group has its
    own common bond - actual or perceptual - as in a common set of
    beliefs, mutual interest or objective. Within these limits we
    find today remnants of primitive society, - i.e., community.
    In the family, within religious cloisters, neighborhoods, small
    work organizations and clubs, the values of reciprocity and retribution
    are paramount.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">To understand this clearly, consider
    how you would feel if your brother or spouse or parent were to
    try to take unfair advantage of you in an exchange. Most of us
    would be appalled by this. Outside of this relation, however,
    you would expect to be treated and to treat another unfairly
    - as in the sale of a used car. Not only do we expect economic
    exploitation, but we <U>respect </U>it - as in &quot;he's a real
    wheeler-dealer&quot; - if we own stock, we <U>demand</U> it from
    our corporation, i.e., maximize profit - the &quot;bottom line.&quot;</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">It is from this distinction - of
    inclusion and exclusion - that much of our problems stem. Violence,
    pollution, rape and harrassment - these all stem from drawing
    our boundaries too tight. By focusing on private profits, we
    often ignore the social costs. What is good for myself today,
    although harmful to others, may ultimately be harmful for everybody.
    As I approach highway construction which restricts traffic to
    one lane, for example, I can either fall in line early or speed
    around and take cuts up front. As I force my way ahead of others,
    I cause other vehicles to brake, causing more delays for everyone
    and producing a potential hazard. Had I filed in line early,
    traffic would have slowed but proceeded safely and smoothly.
    One person's profit very often has social costs.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">From primitive to the present time,
    the community, family, clan or nation has evolved in size and
    structure, expressed in multifareous designs and dynamics. But

    and society is to provide humanity a way of living and functioning
    together. Although this may be the <B>why </B>of it, the <B>how

    growing tendency toward the patriarchate with an older maternal
    system might be decided according to the established land tenure.
    Either the soil was allotted in line with economic principles,
    that is, it was regarded as the work place of the woman, or in
    line with military principles, in which case it was viewed as
    the fruit of conquest and a subject for military protection.
    If the main burden of tillage fell on the woman, the land was
    inherited by the maternal uncle as guardian of the children.
    If on the contrary it was viewed as &quot;spear land&quot; the
    title rested in the military organization; the children were
    counted as belonging to the father, and a further consequence
    was the exclusion of the women from rights in the land. The military
    group sought to maintain the economic basis of military service
    on the part of its members by keeping the allotment of land as
    a function of the paternal clan.&quot; (</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"><A

    of one group of families over the rest was rationalized in terms
    of 'race'. The notion of 'us' and 'the others', connected with
    rules about whom it is proper to marry, arose wherever peoples
    of different language and habits were in contact with each other.
    ... Now superiority became asymmetrical. Better fed, taught to
    cultivate strength and courage, or devoted to subtle scholarship,
    the benefi ciaries of the system could feel themselves different
    beings from the slaves or peasants who supported them, and could
    expect to be acknowledged as such.&quot; </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
