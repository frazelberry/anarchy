    The Principal Terms</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In pursuit of the most
    general aspects or principles of being, this book will consider
    several distinctive terms: being, power, form, change, creativity,
    matter, mind, value, and God. Some of these terms clamor for
    instant treatment, for each that importunes is important in its
    own right and sheds light on other terms. But simultaneous discussion
    is not possible for human reason, which is discursive as well
    as structured, and it is not desirable for the understanding
    of grounds and consequents. In deference to the clamor, however,
    and in order that this book should have no more mystery than
    the subject requires, the major terms may be characterized briefly
    before intensive analysis begins. (44)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Being will be taken as
    the basic term in its area, in preference to such related and
    sometimes competing terms as reality, actuality, existence, and
    becoming. Being is simple and indefinable; it has no character
    or nature of its own; it is contingent. Nonbeing can be similarly
    described. It is incompatible with being but has ontological
    import nonetheless. (44)</FONT></P>
    <P><A NAME="anchor102863"></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Power
    is the primary carrier or vehicle of being: there is no being
    apart from power. Power will be defined as indeterminate intensity
    which tends as immanent causal ground toward change. It will
    be considered under two heads: infrequently as primordial power,
    which is one, spatially interpenetrating, and formless, and usually
    as finite power, which is many, spatially distinct, and typically
    formed. Power is experienced in the domain of mind, and it is
    inferred from physical changes. (44)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Form is the secondary
    carrier of being and the product of power in interaction with
    other power. It is defined as character determinate and unified;
    its species are qualities and relations. (44)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Universals do not have
    a monopoly on form; particular instances of red or of justice,
    considered apart from the power on which they depend, are also
    characters determinate and unified. As products of power, universals
    have no transcendent or timeless being; their reality is described
    by a mixture of conceptualism and moderate realism. (45)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Change is not itself
    a basic carrier of being, but it is a highly general being by
    virtue of its relation first to power and second to form. Change
    and endurance are reciprocals, which are inseparable and equal
    in being. Powers and forms change positions in space and in time,
    and forms come to be and cease. Endurance ultimately is of power,
    which is the same amid all changes of position and form. (45)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Creativity is taken in
    a limited but radical sense. It is not one, universal in space
    and time, and purposive, but many, finite and disconnected, and
    nonpurposive in its &quot;earlier&quot; instances. It consists
    of those factors which have a bearing on the production of novel
    beings, whether positional changes or forms. The primary factor
    is power, which is necessary for creation but does not guarantee
    creation, since the result of power may be negative as well as
    positive: creativity is contingent in power. Its secondary factor
    is form inherited from earlier acts of creation. Creativity is
    understood radically in this book, since all irreducible form
    is regarded as created in time, and its novelty eludes repetition
    and thus explanation. (45)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Matter is finite power
    formed by characters which are relational and spatial, involving
    defined boundary, shape, and size. Its resistance is due to contained
    power; its motion and impact are due to the same power in relation
    with external power similarly formed. (45)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Mind is finite power
    formed by characters which are qualitative and relational, involving
    consciousness, valuation, and symbolic function in an order of
    decreasing generality. The unit of mind is a feeling, which is
    dynamic tendency invested with some degree of consciousness.
    (45)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Value as such is distinct
    from what has value. A basic trait of value as such is an ought-to-be.
    The most general character of what has value is consciousness
    of power fulfilled in freedom. Value and what has value come
    into being with mind: value is not coextensive with being, or
    power, or form. There is no general teleology. (45, 46)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">God, deity, or the holy
    will be considered as a character of human experience and as
    a being beyond man. The holy in human experience has unlimited
    importance. The holy in being is elusive. The tension between
    these two truths is the ultimate existential fact, problem, and
    anguish. (46)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The foregoing terms make
    it possible to define the parts of metaphysics. Primary ontology
    concerns being, which is being as such or being in itself or
    pure being. Secondary ontology deals with principles which are
    coextensive with being or nearly so: for this book, those principles
    are power, change, and form. Philosophical physics, or cosmology,
    studies the principles of being which are spatial and material.
    Philosophical psychology considers the principles of being which
    are mental. And philosophical theology deals with being as infinite,
    and draws accordingly on most or all of the preceding parts of
    metaphysics. For metaphysics, the basic distinction is between
    being and what has being, which causes the distinction between
    primary ontology and the remainder of metaphysics. What has being,
    if sufficiently general, is often confused with or otherwise
    identified with being, so that the two parts of ontology often
    merge in the history of metaphysics. And for materialists and
    ontological idealists, either matter or mind is deemed to be
    coextensive with being, so that philosophical physics or philosophical
    psychology moves into secondary ontology and, by virtue of the
    preceding sentence, may merge with primary ontology. (46)</FONT></P>

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> <B>Theory</B></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">There is some disagreement
    as to the most general and basic term in primary ontology. Five
    terms have some claim to serious consideration: being, reality,
    actuality, existence, and becoming. From Parmenides, Plato, and
    Aristotle to Heidegger and Sartre, being is taken as the basic
    and presumably the most general term, though it may at times
    be opposed to existence or becoming and thus lose generality.
    Reality is probably the basic ontological term in common discourse,
    where it signifies something final and beyond question to common
    thought; the philosopher may be influenced by this usage when,
    in pursuit of something whose reality is not to be doubted, he
    uses the phrase &quot;really real.&quot; From its Latin source,
    <I>res, </I>signifying thing, &quot;reality&quot; has an intimation
    of the concrete, substantial, and temporal, which may limit the
    generality of the term. The term actuality has incisiveness and
    thrust in common discourse, and adherents for one ontological
    purpose or another in philosophy. It appears to be ambiguous,
    for it may signify something that acts and so is temporal, or
    something that is &quot;pure act,&quot; is entirely free of potentiality,
    imperfection, and change, and thus is timeless. Existence usually
    is understood as temporal; in recent decades it has acquired
    the further import of consciousness in pursuit of ultimate value,
    found in infinite being for Kierkegaard, and realized through
    nothingness in the pursuit itself for Sartre. As temporal and
    as conscious, existence has determinations which narrow its generality
    in ontology. The same is true of becoming, which is explicitly
    wedded to change and often is opposed to being. (46, 47)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The principal term in
    primary ontology should be chosen from the preceding list with
    several requirements in mind. It should be capable, without strain,
    of functioning as a generic term under which, in some sense,
    the other terms can be subsumed; without such a generic term
    the list is without unity and its members are deficiently related
    to each other. It should have currency and credit in the history
    of metaphysics. It should have a basis, preferably strong, in
    ordinary language. And it should be distinct from, and preferably
    exclusive of, the principal negative term in ontology, nonbeing
    or nothing. (47)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Being alone satisfies
    these needs. It can readily be divided into the two great domains
    of timeless and temporal being, as in Hartmann's division of
    being <I>(Sein) </I>into ideal being and real being. Here temporal
    or real being is not understood as being in a deficient mode,
    as may be the case with sensible and material objects for Plato's
    <I>Republic </I>and kindred dialogues, nor as being par excellence,
    as may be the case with naturalists, empiricists, and pragmatists
    who cannot wait for secondary ontology to state their case: for
    either alternative, being is ambiguous and cannot function adequately
    in the generic capacity. If the preceding paragraph is correct,
    the ontological terms other than being have temporal and other
    determinations which make them too narrow for the generic position.
    Hartshorne opposes being and becoming, prefers the second as
    the comprehensive term in ontology, and proposes that being may
    be included within becoming, presumably as a moment or factor.
    But being then must bear the imprint of becoming; the timelessness
    identified with it must pass at best into the everlasting; and
    the distinction within becoming between change and the being
    it has is lost sight of. (47, 48)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">It is evident that being
    satisfies the historical test, as indicated by the history of
    the word from Parmenides to Sartre. On the surface at least,
    and below that as the sequel will attempt to show, being is the
    opposite of nonbeing, while some of the alternative terms often
    are thought to depend in part on nonbeing. It is less evident
    that being has a basis in ordinary language. Such a basis is
    clear for &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;existence,&quot; but
    not for &quot;being.&quot; But the noun &quot;being&quot; is
    identical, as sign vehicle, with the present participle &quot;being&quot;
    of the verb &quot;to be.&quot; And the principal finite form
    of &quot;to be&quot; is the verb &quot;is,&quot; which is in
    the dominant tense and person of the infinitive. The word &quot;is&quot;
    is the commonest word from the ontological area in the English
    language. Granting that &quot;is&quot; often has syntactical
    uses in sentences, it also has a regular referential use with
    a clear ontological intent. Consider Matthew Arnold's celebrated
    statement about Keats: &quot;He is; he is with Shakespeare.&quot;'
    &quot;Being&quot; therefore has a strong basis in ordinary language.
    (48)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Of being little can be
    said, and much cannot be said; but the word is not therefore
    meaningless, and being does not vanish into nonbeing. (48)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(1) Being is distinct
    from what is and cannot be described by a what, nature, or form,
    i.e., by an essence. If being had an essence, that essence would
    either agree with a given essence, and thus lead to an automatic
    ontological affirmation; or the essence of being would disagree
    with the given essence, and so prevent an ontological affirmation.
    If the essence of being were the form of internal unity, every
    unified complex would be, despite the evidence of common experience
    and reflective thought to the contrary. In general, the applicability
    in principle of being to any essence requires that being should
    be neutral essentially to all essence. Neither power, nor form,
    nor change, nor any comparable term in metaphysics if there is
    one, can serve for the understanding of being as such. This does
    not prevent power, or form, or change from being coextensive
    with being. (48, 49)<BR>
    </FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(2) Being is simple,
    indefinable, and entirely indeterminate. It is simple, for it
    has no qualities to differentiate it in kind, and no spatial
    relations to divide it in extent. It is indefinable logically,
    for its simplicity forbids analysis of being into a set of terms
    to constitute a definiens. It is indefinable ostensively, for
    pointing is directly at a place, and secondarily at a character,
    and being is neither; the ambiguity of pointing, illustrated
    by pointing at a colored shape, is remedied by repetition and
    contrast, but being is present without contrast. Power is radically
    indeterminate, because it lacks character; being is wholly indeterminate,
    since it lacks in addition power. (49)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(3) Being is identical
    with itself. being is being and, if x has being, then x has being.
    These statements are tautologies and so are analytic to the highest
    degree: they supply no information about being. The self-identity
    of being does not mean that being will continue and be the same
    over any interval of time, however small. A statement to that
    effect is synthetic, informative, and exposed to risk. Still
    less does the self-identity of being imply that what has being
    will continue the same; the self-identity of what has being does
    not imply sameness in time, by the preceding argument, and the
    more remote identity of being cannot accomplish more. Apart from
    the principle of identity, however, being is distinct from change,
    which is an instance of what is or may be. But if being is distinct
    and neutral in regard to change, the endurance of what is cannot
    be imputed to being as such. (49)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Being, however, is predicated
    of change insofar as change is predicated of what is. (49)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(4) Being is contingent
    in several respects. The statement that being is being does not
    entail the statement that being is: the first is analytic and
    convertible into a hypothetical statement, as indicated in the
    preceding paragraph; the second is synthetic and categorical.
    Questions were raised about synthetic necessity in chapter 1,
    section 1: they recur here. An intrinsic necessity may be sought
    in being, such that being may be thought to necessitate itself.
    The necessity cannot be dynamical, since being as such has no
    power. It may be thought of as statical and rational, consisting
    in passage from being as essence to being &quot;proper.&quot;
    But being has no essence to furnish a basis for rational necessity.
    This argument will be pursued further in the concluding chapter
    of this book, where it will concern not being as such but a being,
    which has essence, and is infinite: there as here the ontological
    argument will be rejected. (49, 50)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">If immanent necessity
    has difficulties, so does extrinsic necessity. This necessity
    would be conferred on being by nonbeing or by what is. The discussion
    of nonbeing in the next section will ascribe no being to absolute
    nonbeing; no leverage will then be available in nonbeing for
    the necessitation of being; and if being were so imputed, the
    question of the source of being would be begged. And what is
    cannot confer necessity on being, since it presupposes being.
    Power may necessitate dynamically, but it can do so only to resisting
    power; and power is literally powerless without the being it
    should have the power to necessitate. (50)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(5) The knowledge or
    other apprehension of being is problematic also. Sensation and
    introspection do not reach being as such, since being has no
    sensory or affective qualities and it is distinct from the power
    which may be disclosed by introspection. Reason apparently does
    not reach pure being, for being has no relations and so no structures.
    Intuition does not seem to grasp being; for Bergson, intuition
    discloses either character or the dynamic process that creates
    character, and these belong to form or to power rather than to
    being as such. If Moore was justified in appealing to intuition
    for awareness of good in its simple, indefinable character, that
    justification cannot be transferred here, since being, unlike
    good, has no quality. The indeterminateness of being may suggest
    a mystical access; but the indeterminate totality of mystical
    experience is not empty of essence. If these avenues of awareness
    are not competent, unspecialized emotion may be appealed to,
    as in existentialist theory. The emotion of anguish is a plausible
    approach to nonbeing, and the contrary experiences of hope, joy,
    and courage may be proposed as approaches to being. Sartre's
    reference to nausea and boredom in the apprehension of being
    seems to disturb this division. Emotion can be said to be cognitive
    in the intuitive, preconceptual mode, since it is immediate awareness
    of value and disvalue. Emotion does not itself apprehend the
    object to which value or disvalue is ascribed, whether the object
    is being or what has being: the object is apprehended by one
    of the preceding avenues, which have been found to be deficient
    in relation to being. And the awareness of value does not necessarily
    indicate being rather than nonbeing. If the essence of death
    is bad, the nonbeing of death is good. (50, 51)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">If the foregoing analysis
    is correct, being is not known directly and in itself. If it
    is known, it must be through what has being. Unfortunately, what
    has being is in doubt in regard to its being insofar as being
    is in doubt. The procedure of reflective thought in this situation
    appears to be that stated earlier in the reply to total skepticism.
    Any given essence that is thought to have being is reflectively
    judged to have being if it coheres with a sufficiently large
    system of essences furnished by sensation and introspection.
    These methods are warranted pragmatically because they are the
    field of valuation and action and fulfilment, of problems, solutions,
    and standards. The reflective judgment of what has being appears
    to be as close to the apprehension of being as the mind can go.
    (51)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(6) Being is not a genus
    in relation to what is. A genus appears in<B> </B>the definition
    of its subordinate species, and is necessary for the understanding
    of the species. Being does not appear in the definitions of power,
    form, and change; they are understood through their respective
    essences, in abstraction from the question whether they are or
    are not; it is only after they are understood, whether completely
    or incompletely, that it is meaningful to ask whether they have
    being. And if being is granted, it does not itself add to their
    essences. (51)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(7) Being is a genus
    in relation to other terms of primary ontology. The other terms
    consist of being and differentiae drawn from what is. For Christian
    theology and part of the theology of Whitehead, timeless being
    consists of universal forms, which are abstract, and an infinite
    spirit, which in some sense is concrete. For naturalistic and
    humanistic philosophies, temporal being includes spirit or matter
    or power, characteristically finite, and forms particular and
    universal. Becoming is identical with temporal being, except
    for doctrinal emphases on novelty at the expense of endurance.
    Existence is also identical, except for an emphasis on consciousness
    as center and perhaps as source of change and time. As indicated
    earlier, actuality may fall under either temporal or timeless
    being, with preference for the first in common usage of the word.
    If the thing or substance for reality is taken with emphasis
    on change, the real will coincide with temporal being; if the
    entity is taken as perfect, the real will embrace the infinite
    spirit and even the universal forms of timeless being. Because
    of its scope, reality verges on being, keeping only the notion
    of thing, substance, entity as a reminder of what is. In all
    of these species and varieties of being, being is the same in
    kind and degree, having neither. The difference between the number
    six for a Platonist and six oranges for the ordinary man is not
    in being; it lies in the what, including form and power, for
    which being is claimed or is not claimed. (51, 52)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The seven statements
    about being as such separate being from every what, nature, or
    character. They also hint strongly at a close relation between
    being and what is. The self-identity of being leads thinkers
    to assert the sameness of beings in time, though the one does
    not entail the other. Knowledge of being falters, but attains
    some credence because the structure, or power, or value it reaches
    seems to be so close to being. The species of being cannot be
    stated without reference to what is. There <B>is </B>no paradox
    in the thesis of separation and the hints of union. Being is
    not of itself, according to (4) above; it appears here that,
    in addition, it is not by itself. Being requires a what or essence
    in order to be, whether that essence be conceived as power or
    form, as permanent or changing, as infinite or finite, or as
    mind or matter. And every essence requires being in order to
    function. Power without being is powerless to act. Change stripped
    of being cannot realize the tendency in power. A particular form
    is what it is because it is effect and cause of other forms,
    all under the tending of power; but it has these relations to
    other forms not inherently, but only under the condition that
    it has being. Being and essence are interdependent and thus unified,
    though they are not one since they remain two. (52)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Essence is a concomitant
    of being, if we understand by concomitant something that coexists
    without exception with being. If the preceding paragraph is correct,
    essence must be a concomitant for any metaphysics. For this book,
    the essence in view can be defined further as power, which is
    regarded as having the same coexistence with being. Change is
    not a concomitant, for the tendency of power toward change may
    be blocked by contrary power, and it may be contained and congealed
    in the forms with which it is identified. The persistence of
    subatomic motions suggests that the containment need not be a
    reduction of change. Form is not a concomitant, since it requires
    interaction of powers, which is more complex than bare tendency.
    Form is character determinate and unified, and it is possible
    that either determinateness or unity should be wider in scope
    than their combination. Determinateness occurs in a single part,
    for there are limits between that part and other parts. It does
    not appear in a structureless and infinite whole, which has neither
    internal nor external limits. (52, 53)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Unity taken in a strict
    sense requires a plurality of parts with a common factor; it
    is then narrower than determinateness, if there may be an element
    without a plurality and a plurality without a common factor.
    The concept of unity may be extended in two ways: to include
    the identity of a single element with itself, in which case the
    plurality is provided by the reflexive movement of the element
    upon itself for thought; and to include a structureless whole,
    by reason of its wholeness. Extended in this manner, unity may
    be predicated of any being for its identity, of primordial power
    for its wholeness, of finite powers for the power common to them,
    of forms internally by definition, and of change for its endurance.
    Unity here is a universal property of essence and thus a concomitant
    of being. (53)</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">3. Being: Parmenides,
    Plato, and Heidegger</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This account of being
    may be compared briefly with theories from Parmenides to Heidegger
    in a process of reciprocal evaluation.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">With a caveat due to
    the fragmentary and obscure nature of his extant text, and to
    variations among his interpreters, Parmenides' major theses can
    be rendered in five statements: (1) thought and being are congruent;
    (2) being (or &quot;is&quot;) is; (3) nonbeing is not; (4) being
    is necessary; and (5) being is one, homogeneous, indivisible,
    changeless, and spherical <I>. </I>(53, 54)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Thought, or reason, appears
    here to be identified with the principles of identity and noncontradiction.
    If these principles are analytic, they tell us no more about
    being than we knew before they were applied to that object; if
    they are synthetic, they yield new knowledge, but their congruence
    with being is a problem, which can be resolved if at all only
    at the end of an investigation of being. Parmenides believed
    that we cannot think nonbeing, since any object of thought would
    go to the credit of being, but that we can think being: but reasons
    have been given earlier why reason does not grasp being as such.
    Its only access would be through the principle of identity, which
    would allow the statement that being is being, but would not
    warrant the synthetic statement that being is. The latter statement
    is confirmed by experience of what is, which cannot be denied
    without denying the act of denial, which itself is an instance
    of what is. Nonbeing will be considered at length in the next
    section. Here it may be said on behalf of Parmenides that nonbeing
    as such is excluded by definition from being as such, and thus<B>
    </B>is not available for &quot;is&quot; in the ontological sense;
    but that exclusion does not strip nonbeing of ontological status,
    and so does not forbid diversity and change in the essences that
    constitute what is. The necessity of being has been argued against

    revision of that argument. (54)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The description of being
    as homogeneous and indivisible agrees with the theory of being
    stated in this chapter, which holds that being is distinct from
    all essence, thus has nothing to give it diversity or complexity,
    and therefore is simple. If the meaning of &quot;one&quot; regarding
    being is a unit, or single and simple term, its simplicity repeats
    the terms homogeneous and indivisible. If it is a unity in the
    strict sense, it cannot apply to being, which is simple. If it
    is a unity in the extended sense, it can be predicated of being
    in regard to self-identity. The words &quot;changeless&quot;
    and &quot;spherical&quot; designate essence, and it is probable
    that the three earlier words do so also, with opposite consequences
    for essence in the first two interpretations of one.&quot; Taylor
    believes that Parmenides' world is matter in a single homogeneous
    solid sphere&quot; Kirk and Raven hold that he was &quot;feeling
    his way towards&quot; the incorporeal; and Robin asserts that
    Parmenides opened the way for the doctrine of universal ideas.&quot;
    Although his initial theses were in primary ontology, he appears
    to have moved insensibly to secondary ontology, thus confusing
    being with what has being. (54, 55)</FONT></P>
    <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Plato's Sophist </FONT></I><FONT
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">moves from such confusion to
    a subtle, but clear, distinction between being and other categorial
    terms, which gives support to the distinction made in this chapter
    between being and what has being. The proposal is made that &quot;the
    definition of being is simply power&quot; to &quot;affect another,
    or to be affected by another.&quot; This term resembles, amid
    differences, the basic term of this book; it indicates high generality,
    since it is introduced in search of something which is &quot;common
    to both the corporeal and incorporeal&quot;; it leads to abandonment
    of the earlier Platonic distinction between being and becoming,
    found in the <I>Republic, Phaedrus, Symposium, </I>and kindred
    dialogues, on the ground that mind, which is &quot;present with
    perfect being,&quot; has both motion and rest; but it is not
    acceptable for the account of being as such for the reason given
    in section 2 of this chapter under the first of the seven statements
    about being. The dialogue does not make that distinction between
    being and what has being in relation to power, and it does not
    reject power as the basic term regarding what is; but it proceeds
    with the terms motion and rest in relation to being, with results
    that confirm that distinction. Motion and rest are &quot;in the
    most entire opposition&quot; but they &quot;equally are.&quot;
    If they were identical with being, they would then be identical
    with each other, i.e., both would be motion or both would be
    rest. From this false consequent it is concluded that we must
    &quot;conceive of being as some third and distinct nature, under
    which rest and motion are alike included.&quot;10 Implied here
    is the distinction between statements of identity and statements
    of ordinary predication or attribution. The discussion of being
    then proceeds to distinguish being from the other pair of basic
    terms, the same and the other. Being and the same are not identical,
    for &quot;if they are identical, then again in saying that motion
    and rest have being, we should also be saying that they are the
    same.&quot;&quot; And being is not identical with the other,
    for other is always relative to another, but being is absolute
    as well as other. Motion, rest, same, and other thus participate
    in being but are distinguished from it. All that appears to be
    missing here is a general distinction between being on the one
    hand and the other four terms on the other hand. (55, 56)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In modern philosophy,
    the term being received new emphasis in Hegel and, from his diverse
    influence a century later, in Heidegger and Sartre. Hegel's <I>Science
    of Logic and Logic </I>of the <I>Encyclopaedia </I>devote little
    space to being as such or pure being, which they describe as
    indeterminate and immediate. They are noteworthy for the attempt
    to deduce all other categories from the starting point of pure
    being, and,especially for the attempt to deduce nonbeing or nothing
    from being. These attempts will be considered in section 5, which
    is devoted to the problem of nonbeing. Sartre's <I>Being and
    Nothingness </I>is concerned primarily with being for itself,
    alone and in relation to others of the same name; despite its
    designation, being in itself is not the same as being as such,
    for it is the repository of essence; being as such, if it can
    be distinguished with certainty amid the rich obscurity of Sartre's
    writing, receives some attention, but nothing to compare with
    the exhaustive treatment of the for-itself and nothingness. Although
    Heidegger's <I>Being and Time </I>did not realize the anticipated
    third section on &quot;Time and Being,&quot; but discussed at
    length <I>Dasein </I>or being-there, later work has gone further
    into the problem of being. We may consider his <I>Introduction
    to Metaphysics, </I>whose two hundred pages are concerne(I solely
    with being at a level of high generality and abstraction; the
    book is based on a lecture of 1935, revised and extended, and
    was first published in 1953. (56)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">It will be important
    to pinpoint any distinction that Heidegger may make between being
    as such and whatever essence, nature, or character has being.
    The many passages in which he approaches or touches upon this
    distinction are dense with thought, but not so clear as to lead
    to a firm conclusion. Inquiry into the being of &quot;the essent&quot;
    <I>(d6!s Seiende, </I>what is) goes &quot;beyond essents, and
    deals with being.&quot; But the question of &quot;being as such
    tends to take the same form as the question of the essent as
    such, chiefly because the essential origin of the question of
    the existent as such&quot; remains obscure.The essent means &quot;first
    that which is at any time, in particular this grayish white .
    . . light, brittle mass. But 'the essent' also means . . . that
    which constitutes its being if it is.The next sentence repeat,,;
    the contrast as that between &quot;that which is&quot; and &quot;essentness,
    being.&quot; The second half of each contrast seems to straddle
    the distinction between essent and being, in apparent contradiction
    of the opening statement that being goes beyond essents. Essentness
    should comprise whatever has being in all essent,,;, and it may
    be said to constitute the being of essents in the sense that
    it is the sufficient condition for any essent to be: here, whatever
    has being is not itself being, and the condition for being is
    not itself being. It may be that the two contrasts are meant
    to be between what is specific, derivative, and contingent in
    essence and what is general, basic, and necessary in essence:
    the distinction made in this book between finite or formed powers,,
    including ordinary things, and primordial power or power as such.
    (56, 57)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Heidegger's frequent
    discussion of <I>physis, </I>a term he appropriated from early
    Greek philosophy, may shed light on these issues and on the difficulty
    of drawing a clear distinction in his thought between being as
    such and the essent or what is. <I>Physis &quot;de</I>notes self-blossoming
    emergence . . . opening up, unfolding, that which manifests itself
    in such unfolding and perseveres and endures in it; in short,
    the realm of things that emerge and linger on.&quot; 15 Here<I>
    physis </I>applies to both the act of emerging and the ordinary
    thing, or individual essent, engaged in the act. <I>&quot;Physis</I>
    means the power that emerges and the enduring realm under its
    sway.&quot; Here <I>physis </I>is extended downward to its proper
    nature, to power found in all things or essents; it qualifies
    for the title of essentness, since it is pervasive and basic
    in all essents; and it may be said to constitute the being of
    all essents, since it is the suflicient condition for every essent
    to be. Heidegger would be entitled to say of <I>physis </I>what
    this book says of power, that it is a concomitant of being and
    the carrier of being. But he seems to go a step further and to
    identify it with being as such: <I>&quot;Physis</I> is being
    itself, by virtue of which essents become and remain observable.&quot;17
    The first four words are unequivocal in their identification
    of <I>physis </I>and being as such; but the remainder of the
    sentence may be a retreat to the concomitant of being, with emphasis
    on power as the unformed essent which causes that forming of
    individual essents which constitutes their becoming as individual
    essents. The identification recurs in the statement: &quot;The
    essence of being is <I>physis. &quot;</I>I&quot; It does not
    seem proper to translate that statement into another: that the
    essence of what is, or of the essent, or of all essents, is <I>physis.
    </I>Heidegger appears to have intended that translation: much
    of his book following the initial statements aboutphysis is an
    attempt to find a meaning for the word &quot;being,&quot; as
    though <I>physis </I>were not the answer. (57, 58)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">He recognizes that &quot;we
    cannot immediately grasp the being of the essent itself &quot;;
    that we can explore a building &quot;from cellar to attic&quot;
    and find corridors and rooms but not the being of the building;
    that when we wish &quot;to apprehend being, it is always as though
    we were reaching into the void ... yet we have always rejected
    the contention that the essent in its entirety <I>is not.&quot;</I>
    His grammatical and etymological investigation of the word &quot;being&quot;
    <I>(Sein) </I>confirms the apparent emptiness of the word. The
    infinitive &quot;to be&quot; <I>(sein) </I>&quot;no longer manifests
    what the verb otherwise reveals&quot;; furthermore, &quot;the
    transformation of the infinitive into a verbal substantive [Sein]
    further stabilizes as it were the emptiness that already resided
    in the infinitive; 'sein' is set down like a stable object.'
    And the finite forms of <I>sein</I> have lost their ancient meanings.
    The &quot;entire range of the inflections of the verb 'sein'
    is determined by three different stems&quot; found in Indo-European
    and Germanic languages; &quot;from the three stems we derive
    the three initial concrete meanings: to live, to emerge, to linger
    or endure. These meanings are now extinct; only the abstract
    meaning &quot;to be&quot; has survived. In these processes is
    the explanation of the fact that &quot;the word 'being' is empty
    and its meaning a vapor.' Despite this statement of indeterminate
    meaning, Heidegger finds an aspect of determinateness. Although
    we can doubt the being of a particular essent, &quot;the definite
    distinction between being and nonbeing must be present in our
    minds&quot; in order that the doubt may arise . Furthermore,
    an understanding of being is presupposed by language: &quot;For
    to speak of an essent as such includes: to understand it in advance
    as an essent, that is, to understand its being.' (58)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In pursuit of the meaning
    thus indicated, Heidegger uses two methods. The shorter is to
    consider the meaning of the word &quot;is&quot; in typical statements
    of ordinary language, such as statements that God is, the earth
    is, the cup is of silver, the book is mine. He finds that &quot;a
    single determinate trait&quot; runs through all these modes of
    'is.' &quot;The limitation of the meaning of 'being' remains
    within the sphere of actuality and presence, of permanence and
    duration, of abiding and occurrence.' The longer method is to
    consider being as successively distinguished from becoming, appearance,
    thinking, and the ought. At the conclusion of a remarkable categorial,
    historical, and semantiCal analysis, Heidegger elicits a view
    of being as permanence in contrast with becoming; the always
    identical prototype in contrast with appearance; the &quot;already-there&quot;
    in contrast with thought; and the datum in contrast with the
    ought .27 These meanings of being he summarizes under the heading
    of &quot;enduring presence.&quot; But the terms opposed to being
    are not nothing, but essent; they must be accommodated under
    &quot;being&quot; widened beyond the formula that summarized
    their exclusions. Heidegger does not consider whether the widened
    concept would suffer from the indeterminateness he sought to
    escape, and he gives only a brief formula for the procedure leading
    to the new view of being. The older view of being as enduring
    presence was determined by &quot;thought guided by <I>logos </I>as
    statement&quot;; the new view is determined by the experience
    of time, and specifically a notion of time not influenced by
    that logos. Heidegger finds that &quot;with Aristotle, time itself
    had to be taken as something somehow present.... Consequently
    time was considered from the standpoint of the 'now,' the actual
    moment.... Being in the sense of already-thereness (presence)
    became the perspective for the determination of time. But time
    was not the perspective specially chosen for the interpretation
    of being.' (58, 59)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The revised conception
    of time can also be found in Bergson. But time of any kind is
    a character of essents or of what has being. Neither &quot;enduring
    presence&quot; nor the new formula applies to being as such.
    The determinations of meaning for being considered by Heidegger,
    old or new, belong to essence, nature, or character, not to being
    itself. They appear to violate his own principle stated in transit
    from the traditional conception of being to his revision: &quot;The
    <I>one </I>basic differentiation, whose intensity and fundamental
    cleavage sustain history, is the differentiation between being
    and the essent.' (59)</FONT></P>

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> <B>A</B> <B>Theory</B></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Nonbeing resembles being
    in that nonbeing is distinct from, and other than, any what or
    essence to which it is related. As being is other than what is,
    so nonbeing is other than what is not. Nonbeing differs from
    being in two ways. Nonbeing is incompatible with any what or
    essence with which it is related, while being unites with essence.
    Here there still is a resemblance, for the mutual otherness in
    relation to essence means that neither is a cause, in any Aristotelian
    sense, of the respective conditions of negation and affirmation
    of essence. Coming to be and ceasing to be ordinarily are the
    effects of beings, in which being and essence are united. And
    finally, nonbeing is incompatible with being. In the relation
    of nonbeing to being there is no relation of bare otherness,
    which might permit nonbeing to be thought of as being that is
    other than being. Whether nonbeing is taken as limited and relative
    in scope, as in the nonbeing of health in a sick man, or as unlimited
    and absolute, as in nonbeing &quot;preceding&quot; being and
    all essence in the world as a whole, nonbeing is incompatible
    with being for the scope in question. These three theses regarding
    nonbeing can be developed in the order of the discussion of being
    in the second section of this chapter. (60)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(1) Nonbeing is distinct
    from what is not and cannot be described by any what or essence.
    If nonbeing had an essence, that essence would either agree with
    a given essence, and thus lead to ontological negation; or the
    essence of nonbeing would disagree with the given essence, and
    so prevent an ontological negation. If the essence of nonbeing
    were internal contradiction, every unified complex again would
    be. In general, essence or &quot;meaning&quot; is neutral with
    regard to the distinction between being and nonbeing: a condition
    required for the self-identity of a proposition when affirmed
    and denied.(60)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(2) Nonbeing is simple
    and entirely indeterminate. It has no essence, by the preceding
    paragraph, and so has no basis for<B> </B>differentiation or
    division or determination. It may be thought to have some advantage
    over being, however minimal, in regard to definition, since it
    may be defined as not being. But this definition does not achieve
    the results of definition in the senses of analysis into parts
    or of pointing. And it offers no gain of understanding over the
    definition of being as not nonbeing. The preference for the first
    definition indicates the greater familiarity of being in comparison
    with nonbeing in common experience and thought. But the familiarity
    is a mere appearance, since what is familiar or clear is not
    being but what has being.(60, 61)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(3) Nonbeing is identical
    with itself: nonbeing is nonbeing and, if x has nonbeing, then
    x has nonbeing. This statement, like the similar statement about
    being, is a tautology: it gives no information about nonbeing.
    It does not mean that nonbeing will continue over any interval
    of time: a statement to that effect would be synthetic. The doctrine
    that being has a monopoly on the principle of identity, and that
    nonbeing is identified with a principle of self-contradiction,
    has a perverse logic and semiotic. It would mean that nonbeing
    is identified without having an identity by which to be identified.
    It would also mean that nonbeing would slip into being, so that
    the word &quot;nonbeing&quot; would have no application and the
    word &quot;being&quot; would have more application than it needs.
    The doctrine also confuses nonbeing with what is not: its intent
    is to favor change, but change is a character of what is and
    what is not rather than of nonbeing; nonbeing, like being, is
    neutral in regard to change. (61)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(4) Nonbeing is contingent
    for the most part. The statement that nonbeing is nonbeing does
    not entail the statement that nonbeing is: the one is analytic
    and the other is synthetic. The arguments against synthetic immanent
    necessity for being apply equally well to nonbeing. Nonbeing
    has no power with which to necessitate itself dynamically, and
    no essence to serve as a ground for rational necessity. Synthetic
    extrinsic necessity is also unavailable for nonbeing. Being is
    incompatible with nonbeing and thus cannot necessitate it. What
    is cannot necessitate nonbeing, since it presupposes incompatible
    being. And what is not cannot necessitate nonbeing, since it
    presupposes nonbeing. But nonbeing can be necessitated analytically
    by a complex and self-contradictory essence, such as a round
    square. (61)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Here nonbeing is limited.
    An inductive necessity for limited nonbeing can be found according
    to empirical laws of the destructive action of what is, just
    as a similar necessity for limited being can be found according
    to similar laws of constructive action of what is. (62)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(5) The knowledge of
    nonbeing is as problematic as that of being, since nonbeing like
    being is other than the essences that engage sensation and introspection,
    reason, intuition and mysticism, and emotion. A further problem
    arises for nonbeing. Any cognitive process is a being, whose
    being makes it impossible for the process to engage absolute
    nonbeing. Nonbeing can be known only by a being, and the slightest
    infection of being removes the absolute nonbeing to be known.
    (62)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(6) Nonbeing is not a
    genus in relation to what is not. Nonbeing, like being, does
    not appear in the definitions of essences, which are framed in
    abstraction from the question of being and nonbeing and then
    are submitted to that question.(62)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">These statements emphasize
    the distinction or otherness of nonbeing and essence. The additional
    thesis of the incompatibility of nonbeing and essence, like the
    final thesis of the incompatibility of nonbeing and being, refers
    to what is distinctive in nonbeing. Unlike the final thesis,
    it has a reasonable amount of clarity. Limited nonbeing excludes
    matter, or mind, or a red color, or temperance: exclusions which
    occur in common experience and thought and are the topics of
    common negative judgments. Absolute nonbeing goes a step further
    and excludes, for this book, power, all form, and all change.
    Nonbeing therefore has no concomitant, since it excludes essence
    relative to its scope. Nonbeing is sometimes identified with
    passivity, or resistance, or evil. But passivity and resistance
    are properties of a being or of beings and so presuppose essence,
    which in this book is identified as power, the carrier and concomitant
    of being. Only power can act or be acted upon, and only power
    can resist. Despite his persuasive accounts of nonbeing in relation
    to finitude and anxiety, Tillich is mistaken when he writes of
    the &quot;threat of nonbeing&quot; and of the power of being
    &quot;conquering nonbeing. It is beings, not nonbeing, that threaten
    and, when successful, reduce other beings to nonbeing; and nonbeing
    has no power to be conquered. He is nearer to the truth when
    he says that recent existentialism has given to &quot;nonbeing
    a positivity and a power which contradict the immediate meaning
    of the word. And evil, like good, is not a property of being
    or nonbeing, but a character of essences in relation to a valuing
    being. In common experience and thought, evil is attributed alike
    to the nonbeing of essences that would satisfy desire and to
    the being of essences that thwart desire. (62, 63)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The final thesis is the
    most obscure and difficult of the three. It asserts that nonbeing
    is incompatible with being and, reciprocally, that being is incompatible
    with nonbeing. It is illustrated in the apparent observation
    that the nonbeing of health and the being of health exclude each
    other in any man who can truly be said to have the one condition
    or the other. By extension, absolute nonbeing excludes all beings,
    and any being excludes absolute nonbeing. The thesis appears
    to follow directly from the minimal definition of nonbeing as
    not being. But if nonbeing excludes being, it has no share in
    being, it is false to say that nonbeing is, and true to say that
    nonbeing is not. The last two statements have the authority of
    Parmenides, early but seldom followed. They appear to strip nonbeing
    of any ontological status. Then change as a passage with nonbeing
    at one end and being at the other end is impossible. Absolute
    nonbeing is impossible and being is necessary, contrary to the
    asserted contingency of both. An antinomy develops. If nonbeing
    excludes being, it has a proper identity but no application beyond
    the syntactical &quot;not&quot; of language. If nonbeing includes
    being, it has no identity of its own and no application anywhere.(63)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This difficulty may mean
    that the region of nonbeing is a thicket which reason cannot
    traverse, or that it is so transparent a glass that the mind
    cannot see it. Two ways, however, can be proposed for escape
    from the impasse. One retains the incompatibility of nonbeing
    with being but finds it acceptable for an ontology of nonbeing.
    The other softens the distinction and so holds that nonbeing
    has being in some respect.(63)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The first method asserts
    that the statement, &quot;nonbeing is not,&quot; does not remove
    nonbeing from ontological import, but consummates that import,
    as it were. Nonbeing is the ontological deposit of what is not.
    Every essence, whether power or form, is neutral to the distinction
    of being and nonbeing, so that it is equally meaningful to say
    that an essence is and that it is not. The is-not condition of
    an essence, as of health in a sick man, is the nonbeing of health
    in the man. The is-not condition of every essence, including
    primordial power for this book and every form, is absolute nonbeing.
    The is-not of essence is the meaning of the is-not of nonbeing,
    and the truth of the statement of the first is the correlative
    of the ontological status of the second. Nonbeing as is-not thus
    has meaning for discourse and function in ontology. To ask that
    &quot;is not&quot; be replaced by &quot;is&quot; is to ask that
    essence be introduced into nonbeing, contrary to the second thesis.
    It is to ask that the nonbeing of health be understood as the
    being of the diseased and weakened tissues and functions of the
    sick body, and to ask that absolute nonbeing be thought of as
    an empty container, or ghost, preceding being. In both cases
    nonbeing loses its identity and yields to being. The is-not of
    nonbeing thus does not mean that nonbeing is impossible, except
    in the mode of &quot;is,&quot; which is not intended or required.
    Similarly, being remains contingent, since the alternative of
    absolute nonbeing is viable. It is evident that, for this account,
    the third thesis is subordinate to the second. That subordination
    has merit, since the thesis of the exclusion of essence is more
    clear than the thesis of the exclusion of being. The account
    is complex, subtle, and obscure, like its subject, but is plausible.
    The alternative is to say that being has some magic, or that
    essence has some magic, to necessitate being: a statement which
    is neither clear nor plausible. (63, 64)</FONT></P>

    and Hegel</FONT></B></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The second method has
    several historical exponents. In the <I>Sophist </I>Plato observed
    that &quot;a false proposition will be deemed to be one which
    asserts the non-existence of things which are, and the existence
    of things which are not,' and that the Parmenidean exclusion
    of nonbeing from being means that nonbeing is nothing and that
    a statement about it is meaningless. To rescue falsehood as meaningful,
    the <I>Sophist </I>invokes the category of the other in the thesis
    that nonbeing is being other than being. 'I'he argument for the

    equally be supposed to exist&quot;; and an analogy between the
    not-just and nonbeing, so that the being available to the not-just
    is similarly available to -nonbeing . But the analogy is false,
    since the not-,just, or injustice, has an essence of which being
    can be predicated, whereas nonbeing excludes essence and the
    being available to essence. If the &quot;parts&quot; of the other
    exist as assuredly as the nature of the other, it seems that
    a centaur, as other than man, must exist with man. And the softening
    of the opposite into the bare other does not do justice to nonbeing.
    In the &quot;realm&quot; of essence there is an indefinite number
    of forms other than a given form, of which many are compatible
    with the form, like youth and wisdom with health, and some are
    incompatible, like the forms of disease with health. The being
    of disease excludes the being of health, and the nonbeing of
    health is similarly incompatible with the being of health. In
    the case of absolute nonbeing, there is no essence whose being
    might alleviate the opposition of nonbeing and being. Finally,
    in the <I>Sophist's </I>concluding account of falsity, the sentence
    &quot; 'Theaetetus, with whom I am now speaking, is flying, does
    not depend on a particular other than flying, like the sitting
    ascribed to Th(-,aetetus, for its meaning; it depends on flying
    as a universal form, which is similar to or identical in character
    with the particular flying falsely ascribed to Theaetetus .The
    universal has being of itself for Plato, and it will supply meaning
    to the sentence on any theory that admits the distinction of
    particulars and universals. But the nonbeing of the particular
    flying in question is not compatible with the being of that flying,
    and the relation of the being and the nonbeing is not reduced
    from exclusion to bare otherness by the invocation of universals
    whose nonbeing is not at issue. (65)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A more radical attenuation
    of the distinction between being and nonbeing appears in Hegel's
    <I>Science of Logic. </I>With reservations due to the subtle,
    fluent, and obscure nature of the text, Hegel's theory of the
    interplay of being and nonbeing can be stated in several propositions
    or clusters of propositions. (1) &quot;Being, pure being ...
    has no diversity within itself nor any with a reference outwards.
    . . . It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness.... Being, the
    indeterminate immediate, is in fact nothing .... (2) &quot;Nothing,
    pure nothing: it is ... complete emptiness, absence of all determination
    and contentundifferentiatedness in itself.... Nothing is, therefore,
    the same ... absence of determination, and thus altogether the
    same as, pure being. (3) &quot;Pure being and pure nothing are,
    therefore, the same.... But it is equally true that they are
    ... not the same, that they are absolutely distinct. . . . The
    conjunction of the two statements &quot;is self-contradictory
    and cancels itself out&quot;; it contains &quot;an unrest of
    incompatibles.... (4) The unrest and self-canceling take the
    form of the third member of the triad, becoming, in which being
    and nothing &quot;each immediately vanishes in its opposite.
    &quot;They are not reciprocally sublated . . . but each sublates
    itself in itself and is in its own self the opposite of itself.
    This most abstract level of becoming is not to be confused with
    ordinary becoming, which has &quot;a substratum in which the
    transition takes place&quot; and in which &quot;being and nothing
    are held apart in time.... (5) Since &quot;being and nothing
    are in this unity only as vanishing moments,&quot; and &quot;becoming
    as such is only through their distinguishedness,&quot; the result
    is &quot;the vanishedness of becoming. The result is stable;
    it is not nothing, which is not the &quot;resultant of nothing
    and being&quot;; it is being at the new level of determinate
    being. In determinate being, finitude takes over from abstract
    becoming, and abstract being and nothing are replaced by something
    and other, each of which combines the two antecedents. Something
    is being within its own boundaries and nonbeing in relation to
    what lies beyond, and other is nonbeing in relation to the something
    to which it is other, and being as another something within its
    own limits. (65, 66)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This basic and masterful
    instance of the Hegelian dialectic is nonetheless open to criticism.
    (A) Cluster (1), emphasizing the indeterminateness and emptiness
    of being, truly asserts the distinction made earlier between
    being and essence, nature, or character. Cluster (2) makes the
    same true assertion of the distinction between nonbeing and essence.
    But this common distinction does not make being the same as nonbeing,
    since nonbeing, by the second and third theses about nonbeing
    stated earlier, has incompatibility with essence and with being
    which being does not have. Being therefore is not the same as
    nonbeing; the deduction of nonbeing from being in (1) fails;
    and the first and most crucial step in the dialectical itinerary
    from being to absolute idea loses logical and dialectical force.
    The failure of the deduction does not remove nonbeing from consideration,
    but it makes the entry of nonbeing contingent and empirical and,
    as empirical, limited to relative nonbeing. (B) The statement
    in (3) that being and nothing are not the same is not explained
    by Hegel, though it is manifest from the second and third theses
    stated above. With the removal of the claim of sameness, the
    conjunction in (3) ceases and with it the self-contradiction.
    Abundant contradiction remains, since being and nothing are not
    the same in the maximum degree of incompatibility. (66, 67)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">(C) The synthesis of
    contradictory being and nonbeing in becoming is not impaired
    by the argument of (B). But contrary to (4), becoming does not
    involve the self-opposition of being and of nonbeing, and the
    consequent vanishing of each into the other, for the claim of
    sameness of being and nonbeing has been refuted, and tension
    between sameness and difference in being and in nonbeing has
    disappeared. With these changes in the concept of becoming, the
    terms of becoming are not pure being and pure nonbeing, but essences,
    powers, forms endowed with being in an order of time and, relative
    to their position in that order, with nonbeing. From the finitude
    of essences comes the limited status of the being and nonbeing
    involved in becoming. If this argument is correct, the pure becoming
    of the first triad cannot be deduced from pure being and pure
    nonbeing; it yields to ordinary becoming, which presupposes determinate
    being, something, and other. With the disappearance of pure becoming,
    the derivation in (5) of determinate being from pure becoming
    collapses. This corresponds to the general impossibility of deducing
    essence from being as such. (67)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Despite these criticisms
    of the letter of Hegel's theory, much can be said for the discerning
    spirit behind that letter. Hegel was aware that the principle
    of identity, of itself, does not take us beyond any term or proposition
    to which it is applied. Seeking to combine diversity with pure
    reason, he sought a method to deduce difference from a self-identical
    thesis. The method he came up with was to insert an element of
    opposition into identity, as in the statement in (4) above that
    being and nonbeing each &quot;is in its own self the opposite
    of itself.&quot; The insertion appears to jeopardize the principle
    of identity, by denying that the thesis is itself, and the principle
    of noncontradiction, by asserting that the thesis is equally
    itself and not itself. But both principles are necessary to Hegel's
    method, and he takes pains to affirm the principle of noncontradiction
    in (3) and the principle of identity in the &quot;own self&quot;
    of (4). Without the principle of identity, a thesis would dissolve
    into an indeterminate nothing, leaving reason without a ground
    to support the leap to the opposite or antithesis and making
    every thesis identical with every other thesis. Without the principle
    of noncontradiction, the antithesis would be indifferent to the
    thesis, leaving the antithesis at a standstill. At the same time,
    the application of the principle of noncontradiction to a literal
    contradiction would lead to the elimination of one of the two
    terms, with a return to the original condition of nondiversity.
    With these requirements in mind, we may infer that the opposite
    or antithesis is not the literal contradictory of the thesis,
    but is sufficiently distant from the contradictory to permit
    of coexistence and thus duality, and sufficiently close to the
    contradictory to permit of tension and thus of solution into
    the third term or synthesis. Unfortunately, the antithesis so
    construed has a position which is indeterminate in relation to
    the thesis and therefore cannot be deduced or posited by reason,
    which handles only determinateness. The merit of literal contradiction
    is that it would point the way to a determinate exit from the
    thesis, and thus assist reason to assert a new position. Thus
    the antithesis can at best merely occur, blindly .(68)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Despite the letter to
    the contrary, this formula surely applies to the first triad.
    Nothing as used by Hegel is not the contradictory of being, since
    it omits the second and third theses needed to complete the contradiction.
    It is difficult to conceive of opposites as contradictories when
    an element, at least, of sameness is claimed. Since pure becoming
    has no temporal succession between being and nonbeing, it cannot
    embrace contradictories as ordinary becoming does. The use of
    the phrase &quot;pure becoming&quot; must signify the relation
    of being and nonbeing at a level short of contradiction. Such
    bare otherness cannot be found in being and nonbeing as such;
    it involves essences of some kind; because of the timeless relation
    of the terms, the otherness must be one of universal forms. The
    significance of the emphasis on pure nonbeing in the first triad,
    when only determinate nonbeing or other can enter into the synthesis,
    is that pure nonbeing is a symbol of openness and novelty between
    thesis and antithesis in the dialectic. Ordinary reason, which
    is analytic, tight, and repetitious, does not handle openness
    and novelty. Creativity is the source of these, but it is temporal
    and it eludes explanation and deduction. It appears that pure
    nonbeing for Hegel is a modest approach to the notion of creativity,
    and that his dialectic is an attempt to reconcile creation and
    reason. Hegel stretched the concept of reason as part of that
    attempt, in his insertion of opposition into identity. He did
    not reconcile reason and creation, since the recurrent other
    is not deducible. But he saw the basic roles of reason and creation
    in the world and in ontology, and the basic problem of their
    relation, and the significance of nonbeing as at least a metaphor
    in that relation. And the tension of opposites, and its resolution
    in novel synthesis, suggests the tension of powers in the creation
    of forms. Tension is a metaphor among forms, but a literal relation
    among powers. (68, 69)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
