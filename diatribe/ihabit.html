    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Whenever in the present moment</FONT><FONT
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> our mind projects a memory-image
    from the past, thereby betraying an attachment thereto, our consciousness
    is torn and divided between the present and the past. It is this
    division which is the fundamental element of the tension which
    engenders the 'I-process'. The function of the mind is not to
    store up memories, but to understand the process of its own functioning
    in the present. <BR>

    Schematically the brain could be drawn as a point or centre of
    pure perception endowed with extraordinary sensibility. Everything
    happening around this point is continually registered as electro-magnetic
    perturbations. And though at the beginning they were impersonal
    and without any individuality, they have become mechanical memories
    comparable with those of sound recorders.</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Finally this accumulation
    of memory becomes so complex and dense that secondary phenomena
    begin to appear. The memories become so loaded that suddenly
    by the natural affect of certain 'law of mass', reciprocal action
    takes place between the different layers of superimposed engrams.
    Secondary currents spring up and set of a whole process of 'parasitic'
    phenomena. The Sages believe that consciousness of self is nothing
    other than a 'secondary current', a 'parasitical phenomenon.'</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Thus an entity has been
    built up on what was a simple impersonal non-individualized process
    of pure-perception. It has been erected as a result of the impression
    of psychological solidity given by the complexity of memory accumulations.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
