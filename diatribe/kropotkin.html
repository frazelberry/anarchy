  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Many stems had no force
  to resist disintegration; they broke up and were lost for history.
  But the more vigorous ones did not disintegrate. They came out
  of the ordeal with a new organization - the village community
  - which kept them together for the next fifteen centuries or
  more. The conception of a common territory, appropriated or protected
  by common efforts, was elaborated, and it took the place of the
  vanishing conceptions of common descent. The common gods gradually
  lost their character of ancestors and were endowed with a local
  or territorial character. They became the gods or saints of a
  given locality; &quot;the land&quot; was identified with its
  inhabitants &#133; (120)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A very long evolution
  was required before the gentes, or clans, recognized the separate
  existence of a patriarchal family in a separate hut; but even
  after that had been recognized, the clan, as a rule, knew no
  personal inheritance of property. The few things which might
  have belonged personally to the individual were either destroyed
  on his grave or buried with him. The village community, on the
  contrary, fully recognized the private accumulation of wealth
  within the family and its hereditary transmission. But wealth
  was conceived exclusively in the shape of movable property, including
  cattle, implements, arms, and the dwelling-house which &quot;like
  all things that can be destroyed by fire&quot; - belonged to
  the same category. As to private property in land, the village
  community did not, and could not, recognize anything of the kind,
  and, as a rule, it does not recognize it now. The land was the
  common property of the tribe, or of the whole stem, and the village
  community itself owned its part of the tribal territory so long
  only as the tribe did not claim a re-distribution of the village
  allotments. (12ouse which &quot;like all things that can be destroyed
  by fire&quot; - belonged to the same category. As to private
  property in land, the village community did not, and could not,
  recognize anything of the kind, and, as a rule, it does not recognize
  it now. The land was the common property of the tribe, or of
  the whole stem, and the village community itself owned its part
  of the tribal territory so long only as the tribe did not claim
  a re-distribution of the village allotments. (124, 125)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A whole series of institutions,
  partly inherited from the clan period, have developed from that
  basis of common ownership of land during the long succession
  of centuries which was required to bring the barbarians under
  the dominion of States organized upon the Roman or Byzantine
  pattern. The village community was not only a union for guaranteeing
  to each one his fair share in the common land, but also a union
  for common culture, for mutual support in all possible forms,
  for protection from violence, and for a further development of
  knowledge, national bonds, and moral conceptions; and every change
  in the judicial, military, education or economic manners had
  to be decided at the folkmotes in the village, the tribe, or
  the confederation. The community being a continuation of the
  gens, it inherited all its functions. It was the universitas,
  the mir - a world in itself.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Common hunting, common
  fishing, and common culture of the orchards or the plantations
  of fruit trees was the rule with the old gentes. Common agriculture
  became the rule in the barbarian village communities. True, that
  direct testimony to this effect is scarce, and in the literature
  of antiquity we only have the passages of Diodorus and Julius
  Caesar relating to the inhabitants of the Lipari Islands, one
  of the Celt-Iberian tribes, and the Sueves. But there is no lack
  of evidence to prove that common agriculture was practiced among
  some Teuton tribes, the Franks, and the old Scotch, Irish and
  Welsh. (126)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&#133; Moreover, it is
  well known that many tribes of Brazil, Central America, and Mexico
  used to cultivate their fields in common, and that the same habit
  is widely spread among some Malayans, in New Caledonia, which
  several Negro stems, and so on. In short, communal culture is
  so habitual with many Aryan, Ural-Altayan, Mongolian, Negro,
  Red Indian, Malayan, and Melanesian stems that we must consider
  it as a universal - though not as the only possible - form of
  primitive agriculture. (127)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Sociability and need
  of mutual aid and support are such inherent parts of human nature
  that at no time of history can we discover men living in small
  isolated families, fighting each other for the means of subsistence.
  On the contrary, modern research &#133; proves that since the
  very beginning of their prehistoric life men used to agglomerate
  into gentes, clans, or tribes, maintained by an idea of common
  descent and by worship of common ancestors. It has deeply impressed
  all subsequent development of mankind; and when the bonds of
  common descent had been loosened by migrations on a grand scale,
  while the development of the separated family within the clan
  itself had destroyed the old unity of the clan, a new form of
  union, territorial in its principle - the village community -
  was called into existence by the social genius of man. (133,
  134)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"></FONT><A NAME="anchor642210"></A><FONT
   SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&#133; In olden times, when a
  king sent his vogt to a village, the peasants received him with
  flowers in one hand and arms in the other, and asked him - which
  law he intended to apply: the one he found in the village, or
  the one he brought with him? And, in the first case, they handed
  him the flowers and accepted him; while in the second case they
  fought him. Now, they accepted the king's or the lord's official
  whom they could not refuse; but they maintained the folkmote's
  jurisdiction, and themselves nominated six, seven, or twelve
  judges, who acted as arbiters and sentence-finders. In most cases
  the official had nothing left to him but to confirm the sentence
  and to levy the customary fred. This meant self-administration
  and self-legislation, had been maintained through all the struggles;
  and even the lawyers by whom Karl the Great was surrounded could
  not abolish it; they were bound to confirm it. At the same time,
  in all matters concerning the community's domain, the folkmote
  retained its supremacy and (as shown by Maurer) often claimed
  submission from the lord himself in land tenure matters. No growth
  of feudalism could break this resistance; the village community
  kept its ground; and when, in the ninth and tenth centuries,
  the invasions of the Normans, the Arabs, and the Ugrians had
  demonstrated that military scholoe were of little value for protecting
  the land, a general movement began all over Europe for fortifying
  the villages with stone walls and citadels. Thousands of fortified
  centres where then built by the energies of the village communities
  and, once they had built their walls, once a common interest
  had been created in this new sanctuary - the town walls - they
  soon understood that they could henceforward resist the encroachments
  of the inner enemies, the lords, as well as the invasions of
  foreigners. A new life of freedom began to develop within the
  fortified enclosures. The medieval city was born. (164, 165)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"></FONT><A NAME="anchor646068"></A><FONT
   SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The whole process of liberation
  progressed by a series of imperceptible acts of devotion to the
  common cause, accomplished by men who came out of the masses
  - by unknown heroes whose very names have not been preserved
  by history. The wonderful movement of the God's peace (treuga
  Dei) by which the popular masses endeavoured to put a limit to
  the endless family feuds of the noble families, was born in the
  young towns, the bishops and the citizens trying to extend to
  the nobles the peace they had established within their own town
  walls &#133; (167)</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor670851"></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&#133;
  In fact, the intellectual movement which has been described as
  the Twelfth Century Renaissance and the Twelfth Century Rationalism
  - the precursor of the Reform - date from that period, when most
  cities were still simple agglomerations of small village communities
  enclosed by walls. (169)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">However, another element,
  besides the village community principle, was required to give
  to these growing centres of liberty and enlightenment the unity
  of thought and action, and the powers of initiative, which made
  their force in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. With the
  growing diversity of occupations, crafts and arts, and with the
  growing commerce in distant lands, some new form of union was
  required, and this necessary new element was supplied by the
  guilds. &#133; (169)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&#133; The city organized
  itself as a federation of both small village communities and
  guilds. (177)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The craft guild was then
  a common seller of its produce and a common buyer of the raw
  materials, and its members were merchants and manual workers
  at the same time. Therefore, the predominance taken by the old
  craft guilds from the very beginnings of the free city life guaranteed
  to manual labour the high position which it afterwards occupied
  in the city. In fact, in a medieval city manual labour in a &quot;mystery&quot;
  was considered as a pious duty towards the citizens; a public
  function as honourable as any other. An idea of &quot;justice&quot;
  to the community, of &quot;right&quot; towards both producer
  and consumer, which would seem so extravagant now, penetrated
  production and exchange &#133; (191)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A difference between
  master and apprentice, or between master and worker &#133;, existed
  in the medieval cities from their very beginnings; but this was
  at the outset a mere difference of age and skill, not of wealth
  and power. After a seven years' apprenticeship, and after having
  proved his knowledge and capacities by a work of art, the apprentice
  became a master himself. And only much later, in the sixteenth
  century, after the royal power had destroyed the city and the
  craft organization, was it possible to become master in virtue
  of simple inheritance or wealth. But this was also the time of
  a general decay in medieval industries and art. (193)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The craft organization
  required, of course, a close supervision of the craftsmen by
  the guild, and special jurates were always nominated for that
  purpose. But it is most remarkable that, so long as the cities
  lived their free life, no complaints were heard about the supervision;
  while, after the State had stepped in, confiscating the property
  of the guilds and destroying thei independence in favour of its
  own bureaucracy, the complaints became simply countless. On the
  other hand, the immensity of progress realized in all arts under
  the medieval guild system is the best proof that the system was
  no hindrance to individual initiative. &#133; (196, 197)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&#133; The burgher could
  not understand that equal rights of citizenship might be granted
  to the peasant upon whose food supplies he had to rely, and a
  deep rent was traced between town and village. In some cases
  the peasants simply changed owners, the city buying out the patron's
  rights and selling them in shares to her own citizens. Serfdom
  was maintained, and only much later on, towards the end of the
  thirteenth century, it was the craft revolution which undertook
  to put an end to it, and abolished personal servitude, but dispossessed
  at the same time the serfs of the land. It hardly need to be
  added that the fatal results of such policy were soon felt by
  the cities themselves; the country became the city's enemy. (203)</FONT></P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor741939"></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&#133;
  Towards the end of the fifteenth century, mighty States, reconstructed
  on the old Roman pattern, were already coming into existence.
  In each country and each region some feudal lord, more cunning,
  more given to hoarding, and often less scrupulous than his neighbors,
  had succeeded in appropriating to himself richer personal domains,
  more peasants on his lands, more knights in his following, more
  treasures in his chest. He had chosen for his seat a group of
  happily-situated villages, not yet trained into free municipal
  life - Paris, Madrid or Moscow - and with the labor of his serfs
  he had made of them royal fortified cities, whereto he attracted
  war companions by a free distribution of villages, and merchants
  by the protection he offered to trade. The germ of a future State,
  which began gradually to absorb other similar centres, was thus
  laid. Lawyers, versed in the study of Roman law, flocked into
  such centres; a tenacious and ambitious race of men issued from
  among the burgesses, who equally hated the haughtiness of the
  lords and what they called the lawlessness of the peasants. The
  very forms of the village community, unknown to their code, the
  very principles of federalism were repulsive to them as &quot;barbarian&quot;
  inheritances. Caesarism, supported by the fiction of popular
  consent and by the force of arms, was their ideal, and they worked
  hard for those who promised to realise it. (216)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The Christian Church,
  once a rebel against Roman law and now its ally, worked in the
  same direction. The attempt at constituting the theocratic Empire
  of Europe having proved a failure, the more intelligent and ambitious
  bishops now yielded support to those whom they reckoned upon
  for reconstituting the power of the Kings of Israel or of the
  Emperors of Constantinople. The Church bestowed upon their rising
  rulers her sanctity, she crowned them as God's representatives
  on earth, she brought to their service the learning and the statesmanship
  of her ministers, her blessings and maledictions, her riches,
  and the sympathies she had retained among the poor. The peasants,
  whom the cities had failed or refused to free, on seeing the
  burghers impotent to put an end to the interminable wars between
  the knights - which wars, they had so dearly to pay for - now
  set their hopes upon the King, the Emperor, or the Great Prince;
  and while aiding them to crush down the mighty feudal owners,
  they aided them to constitute the centralized state. &#133; Mighty
  states made their appearance; and the cities had now to resist
  not only loose federations of lords, but strongly-organized centres,
  which had armies of serfs at their disposal. (217)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The worst was, that the
  growing autocracies found support in the divisions which had
  grown within the cities themselves. The fundamental idea of the
  medieval city was grand, but it was not wide enough. Mutual aid
  and support cannot be limited to a small association; they must
  spread to its surroundings, or else the surroundings will absorb
  the association. &#133; Instead of looking upon the peasants
  and artisans who gathered under the protection of his walls as
  upon so many aids who would contribute their part to the making
  of the city - as they really did - a sharp division was traced
  between the &quot;families&quot; of old burghers and the newcomers.
  For the former, all benefits from communal trade and communal
  lands were reserved, and nothing was left for the latter but
  the right of freely using the skill of their own hands. The city
  thus became divided into &quot;the burghers&quot; or &quot;the
  commonality&quot;, and &quot;the inhabitants&quot;. &#133; (218)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"></FONT><A NAME="anchor650329"></A><FONT
   SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->The
  same division took place between the city proper and the surrounding
  villages. The commune had well tried to free the peasants, but
  her wars against the lords became, as already mentioned, wars
  for freeing the city itself from the lords, rather than for freeing
  the peasants. She left to the lord his rights over the villeins,
  on condition that he would molest the city no more and would
  become co-burgher. But the nobles &quot;adopted&quot; by the
  city, and now residing within its walls, simply carried on the
  old war within the very precincts of the city. They disliked
  to submit to a tribunal of simple artisans and merchants, and
  fought their old feuds in the streets. &#133; Drawing large incomes
  from the estates they had still retained, they surrounded themselves
  with numerous clients and feudalized the customs and habits of
  the city itself. And when discontent began to be felt in the
  artisan classes of the town, they offered their sword and their
  followers to settle the differences by a free fight, instead
  of letting the discontent find out the channels which it did
  not fail to secure itself in olden times. (218, 219)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The greatest and most
  fatal error of most cities was to base their wealth on commerce
  and industry, to the neglect of agriculture. They thus repeated
  the error which had once been committed by the cities of antique
  Greece, and they fell through it into the same crimes. The estrangement
  of so many cities from the land necessarily drew them into a
  policy hostile to the land, which became more and more evident
  in the time of Edward the Third, the French Jacqueries, the Hussite
  wars, and the Peasant War in Germany. On the other hand, a commercial
  policy involved them in distant enterprises. Colonies were founded
  by the Italians in the southeast, by German cities in the east,
  by Slavonian cities in the far northeast. Mercenary armies began
  to be kept for colonial wars, and soon for local defense as well.
  Loans were contracted to such an extent as to totally demoralize
  the citizens, and internal contests grew worse at each election,
  during which the colonial politics in the interests of a few
  families was at stake. The division into rich and poor grew deeper,
  and in the sixteenth century, in each city, the royal authority
  found ready allies and support among the poor. (219, 220)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The students of Roman
  law and the prelates of the church, closely bound together since
  the time of Innocent the Third, had succeeded in paralyzing the
  idea - the antique Greek idea - which presided at the foundation
  of the cities. For two- or three-hundred years they taught from
  the pulpit, the University chair, and the judges' bench, that
  salvation must be sought for in a strongly centralized state,
  placed under a semi-divine authority; that one man can and must
  be the saviour of society, and that in the name of public salvation
  he can commit any violence; burn men and women at the stake,
  make them perish under indescribable tortures, plunge whole provinces
  into the most abject misery &#133; (220, 221)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">However, before submitting
  for three centuries to come, to the all-absorbing authority of
  the State, the masses of the people made a formidable attempt
  at reconstructing society on the old basis of mutual aid and
  support. It is well known by this time that the great movement
  of the reform was not a mere revolt against the abuses of the
  Catholic Church. It had its constructive ideal as well, and that
  ideal was life in free, brotherly communities. Those of the early
  writings and sermons of the period which found most response
  with the masses were imbued with ideas of the economical and
  social brotherhood of mankind. The &quot;Twelve Articles&quot;
  and similar professions of faith, which were circulated among
  the German and Swiss peasants and artisans, maintained not only
  every one's right to interpret the Bible according to his own
  understanding, but also included the demand of communal lands
  being restored to the village communities and feudal servitudes
  being abolished, and they always alluded to the &quot;true&quot;
  faith - a faith of brotherhood. At the same time scores of thousands
  of men and women joined the communist fraternities of Moravia,
  giving them all their fortune and living in numerous and prosperous
  settlements constructed upon the principles of communism. Only
  wholesale massacres by the thousand could put a stop to this
  widely-spread popular movement, and it was by the sword, the
  fire, and the rack that the young States secured their first
  and decisive victory over the masses of the people. (224, 225)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For the next three centuries
  the States, both on the Continent and in these islands, systematically
  weeded out all institutions in which the mutual-aid tendency
  had formerly found its expression. The village communities were
  bereft of their folkmotes, their courts and independent administration;
  their lands were confiscated The guilds were spoliated of their
  possessions and liberties, and placed under the control, the
  fancy, and the bribery of the State's official. The cities were
  divested of their sovereignty, and the very springs of their
  inner life - the folkmote, the elected justices and administration,
  the sovereign parish and the sovereign guild - were annihilated;
  the State's functionary took possession of very link of what
  formerly was an organic whole. &#133; The State alone, and the
  State's church, must represent loose aggregations of individuals,
  connected by no particular bonds, bound to appeal to the Government
  each time that they fell a common need. &#133; (226, 227)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The absorption of all
  social functions by the State necessarily favoured the development
  of an unbridled, narrow-minded individualism. In proportion as
  the obligations toward the State grew in numbers the citizens
  were evidently relieved from their obligations towards each other.
  In the guild - and in medieval times every man belonged to some
  guild or fraternity - two &quot;brothers&quot; were bound to
  watch by turns a brother who had fallen ill; it would be sufficient
  now to give one's neighbor the address of the next paupers' hospital.
  In barbarian society, to assist at a fight between two men, arisen
  from a quarrel, and not to prevent it from taking a fatal issue,
  meant to be oneself treated as a murderer; but under the theory
  of the all-protecting State the bystander need not intrude; it
  is the policeman's business to interfere, or not. And while in
  a savage land, among the Hottentots, it would be scandalous to
  eat without having loudly called out thrice whether there is
  not somebody wanting to share the food, all that a respectable
  citizen has to do now is to pay the poor tax and to let the starving
  starve. The result is, that the theory which maintains that men
  can, and must, seek their own happiness in a disregard of other
  people's wants is now triumphant all around - in law, in science,
  in religion. It is the religion of the day, and to doubt of its
  efficacy is to be a dangerous Utopian. &#133; (227, 228)</FONT></P>
