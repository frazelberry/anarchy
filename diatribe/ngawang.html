<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">THE ASSERTION OF SELF</FONT></B></P>

<P>The non-Buddhist systems assert the existence of a substantially
existent self based on scripture and counterfeit reasoning. The
scriptures are those transmitted from one to another, setting
forth the existence of a personal self. The reasonings are:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>A self exists because without prior consideration, when phenomena
  such as the shape of a face are seen, the thought of the presence
  of a person is generated, not just the thought of the presence
  of a shape.</P>
  <P>A self exists because without prior consideration, when enjoyment
  preponderantly of pleasurable feelings is perceived, the thought
  of the presence of a high person is generated, not just of feeling.
  When enjoyment preponderantly of painful feelings is perceived,
  the thought of the presence of a low person is generated, not
  just of feeling. (307)</P>
  <P>When the name 'Devadatta' is designated, one thinks of a person,
  not just of a discrimination of the name.</P>
  <P>When engagement in afflictions - such as desire - or virtues
  - such as faith - are perceived, the thought of the presence
  of a childish person or a wise person is generated, not just
  of engagement.</P>
  <P>When the mind understands its objects through the eyes and
  so forth, one does not just think that the mind sees but that
  'I see.' This shows that there is a sentient being, or I separate
  from the mind.</P>
  <P>If there were no self separate from the mental and physical
  aggregates, one would not think, 'I have seen a form,' or 'I
  will see a form,' but would only think of the aggregates as engaging
  in activities. However, this is not the case; one must definitely
  think of the self prior to engagement in activities.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">BUDDHIST REFUTATION OF SELF</FONT></B></P>

<P>Since those seeking liberation must completely refute the referent
object of the view of the transitory collection as a real I and
must assert a mere I or mere person, they must become skilled
in the ways of refutation and proof through reasoning. Otherwise,
falling to the extreme either of asserting no I at all or of affirming
a substantially existent I, all their efforts will be senseless.
Since the mere person is not to be refuted, a person as qualified
by a certain attribute is. This is called a true (*<I>satyaka,
bden pa</I>), ultimate (<I>paramartha, don dam</I>), or substantially
existent (<I>dravyasat, rdzas yod)</I> person. (308)</P>

<P>In short, the person is conceived to exist substantially whereas
it only exists imputedly (<I>prajnaptisat, btags yod</I>). Here,
an imputedly existent object is a phenomenon, such as a forest
or army, which when it appears as an object of the mind must depend
on the appearance of some other basis which has a character different
from it, such as trees or soldiers. However, the substantially
existent appears under its own power without depending on such-for
instance, a tree or soldier. This explanation of 'substantial
existence' comes from the lower systems because in the Prasangika
system nothing substantially exists since the appearance of any
phenomenon must depend on the appearance of its basis of imputation,
which is not itself. (308, 309)</P>

<P>1. <I>Refuting the reasoning that the person substantially
exists because it is observed that when phenomena such as the
shape of a face are seen, the thought of the presence of a person
is generated without prior consideration</I></P>

<P>Are phenomena, such as the shape of a face and so forth, perceived
and the thought of a sentient being generated with respect to
them, or is something else perceived and the thought of a sentient
being generated with res<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->pect
to it? If the former, then that thought is erroneous because it
conceives such to be a sentient being whereas a sentient being
is other than the shape of a face and so forth. If the latter,
one has let fall the position that the thought of a sentient being
is generated only from perceiving such phenomena. (309)</P>

<P>Does that base which, when perceived, generates the thought
of a sentient being have the nature of a sentient being or not?
If the former, then that thought is erroneous because the sentient
being appears to be self-sufficient in the sense of having a character
different from that of the mind and body. If the latter, then
one would have to assert that even a pot could serve as a cause
generating the thought of woolen cloth. (309)</P>

<P>Do you accept that the thought of a sentient being can be generated
with respect to what is not a sentient being or not? If not, it
is manifestly contradicted by the experience of generating the
thought of a human to a pile of stones seen in the distance. If,
however, the thought of a sentient being can be generated with
respect to what is not a sentient being, then the basic assertion
that the thought of a sentient being understands its object just
as it is is indefinite. (309)</P>

<P>Do you accept that the thought of non-sentient being can be
generated with respect to a sentient being? Do you accept that
the thought of a certain sentient being can be generated with
respect to another sentient being? (309, 310)</P>

<P>When the aggregates are perceived, is the base that generates
the thought of a sentient being manifest or hidden? If manifest,
then the aggregates would be the sentient being because another
phenomenon not included among them is not manifestly perceived.
If hidden or obscure, then a small untrained child would not generate
a thought of a sentient being. (310)</P>

<P><I>2 Refuting that the person substantially exists just because
it is observed that one engages in activities having first thought,
'I will murder,'or 'I will forsake murder'</I></P>

<P>Do these activities arise from mental causes or from the cause
of the self? If the former, then one has let fall the position
that these are activities of a substantially existent person.
If the latter, then it contradicts the position that these activities
are preceded by thought. (310)</P>

<P>Is the cause of the activities permanent or impermanent? If
permanent, then it could not act. If impermanent, then these could
not be the activities of a permanent self. (310)</P>

<P>Does the sentient being who is the agent have a nature of exertion
or non-exertion? If the former, then the self could not be permanent.
If the latter, it would be contradictory to say that the non-exerting
exerts. (310)</P>

<P>Do the activities of a sentient being have causes or not? If
not, then the activities would always be performed. If caused,
then since they would be preceded by other causes, they would
not be the independent activities of a self. (310)</P>

<P>Are activities performed under one's own power or under the
influence of the other? If the former, then the sufferings of
birth, aging, sickness, death, and so forth would never be experienced
because what one experienced would be in one's own power. If the
latter then it would not be suitable for these to be the activities
of the self because the self is asserted to be under its own power.
(310)</P>

<P><I>3 Imputation of the self to the aggregates</I></P>

<P>If the person is imputed to the mental and physical aggregates,
then it could not be a self-sufficient entity different from the
aggregates. (310, 311)</P>

<P>If the person abides in the aggregates like a pile of grain
in a mandala, is the person permanent or impermanent? If permanent,
then it could not be helped or harmed by pleasure and pain; hence,
it would not accumulate virtuous and non-virtuous actions (<I>karma
las</I>) and thus would not assume a body, in which case there
would be no sense in asserting it as a person. If impermanent,
then something that is other than the aggregates and is produced
and disintegrates would have to be observed, but it is not. (311)</P>

<P>If the person is other than the aggregates (which include all
products) like sticks set side by side, then since the person
would be a non-product, it would be senseless to assert it. (311)</P>

<P>If the aggregates do not exist at all, then since there could
be no relation with fetters, one would be liberated effortlessly.
(311)</P>

<P><I>4 Positing the character of the person</I></P>

<P>If a person separate from the aggregates exists, does it have
the nature of being the viewer of forms and so forth or not? If
it does, is it imputed to the eye consciousness and so forth or
is it another object altogether? If the former, then it could
not be substantially existent. (311)</P>

<P>If the self is the viewer of forms and so forth but is other
than the eye consciousness, then it would be either the object
or the instrument of viewing. If it is the object, then it would
be the basis of the activity of viewing. This could be in the
sense of, like a seed, newly producing its own similar type in
the next moment, but then the viewer would be impermanent, not
permanent as is asserted. Or, this could be in the sense of transformation,
like a potter or a human with magical powers, but then it would
be impermanent and conventional. If just as a magician emanates
illusions under his own power, so the self is under its own power,
then the viewer would not undergo any suffering. The self might
be conceived as the basis of the activity of viewing in the same
way as the earth serves as the basis of and destroys the moving
(sentient beings) and non-moving (the environment), but this is
not observed in the self. Or, the self could be the basis of activity,
like space, in the sense that one can stretch out and contract
one's limbs in space which is non-obstructive, but this also is
not observed in the self. Furthermore, if just as space is posited
to a mere elimination of obstructive contact, so the viewer is
posited to a mere elimination of its object of negation, then
the self could not appear to the mind under its own power because
it would be a mere absence. (311, 312)</P>

<P>If the viewer is the instrument of viewing, then like a sickle,
its engaging in activity would definitely depend on an agent in
which case it would be dual-natured, being both that which engages
the object (as the instrument) and that which is engaged in the
object (as the object upon which the agent acts). If, like a fire,
it sometimes engages its objects under its own power without an
agent (as in spontaneous combustion), then it would be senseless
to assert the existence of the person in fear of the lack of,
an agent. (312)</P>

<P>If the person does not have the nature of being the viewer
of forms and so forth, then it is senseless to assert a person
that does not have any valid cognition. (312)</P>

<P><I>5 Positing the self as afflicted and purified</I></P>

<P>Does the self have the character of being afflicted and purifier
or is it other than these? If it does, then it would be unreasonable
to assert a person separate from the aggregates because food,
clothing, and so forth help the self, imbalance of the element
and so forth harm it, and afflictions are perceived only in the
aggregates, not in anything else. If the self does not have the
character of the afflicted and the purified, then it could not
be afflicted and purified. (312)</P>

<P><I>6 Positing the self as engaging and disengaging</I></P>

<P>Does a person who has the character of engagement and disengagement
engage and disengage or does a person who does not have the character
of engagement and disengagement do such? If the former, then a
person separate from the aggregates could not exist because the
activity of engagement is observed only in phenomena of the aggregates.
There is (1) engagement by way of having causes, like the body
from its causes of semen, blood, and so forth, (2) engagement
by way of having a nature of production, like a sprout, (3) engagement
by way of having a nature of disintegration, like the gradual
descent of a waterfall, (4) engagement from the one to the other
like the connection of a flame to its next moment of similar type,
and (5) engagement of transformation-having done one activity,
engaging in another - like mounting a mount and thereby changing
one's situation. All of these are observed only in the aggregates.
(312, 313)</P>

<P>If a person who does not have the character of engagement and
disengagement engages and disengages, then the self would not
become engaged, because of not having the character of engagement.
Since disengagement depends on a previous engagement, it is impossible
when engagement is impossible. (313)</P>

<P><I>7 Positing the self as the experiencer, agent, and liberator</I></P>

<P>Is something that is affected by pleasure and pain which are
generated by objects asserted as the experiencer or is one who
is not? One who is not affected by pleasure and pain could not
be the experiencer since something that is helped or harmed from
enjoying objects of experience is the meaning of an experiencer.
If something that is affected by pleasure and pain generated by
objects is the experiencer, then it is senseless to say that the
self substantially exists because the state of being affected
is perceived only in impermanent products. (313)</P>

<P>Is something that is affected by the mind asserted as the agent,
or is something that is not? As above, being affected is perceived
only in impermanent products. Something that is not affected by
the mind is not an agent because 'agent' means something that
is affected by the mind. (313)</P>

<P>Is something that is affected by the root and secondary afflictions
asserted as the self that is liberated or is something that is
not? As above, being affected is observed only in impermanent
products. Something that is not affected by the afflictions could
not be liberated because of not having been formerly bound. (313)</P>

<P><I>8 Positing the self as the instrument</I></P>

<P>Is agentship posited only to the self or can it also be posited
to others? If only the self, then it would not be suitable to
say 'The light of burning fire illuminates the area,' indicating
an agent other than the self. If others can be posited as agents,
then it would be allowable to designate the selp as the agent
in seeing, hearing, and so forth, but there would be no point
in asserting a substantially existent self. (314)</P>

<P><I>9 Positing the self as what is expressed by &#145;person'</I></P>

<P>Is the verbal convention 'person' used only for the self or
also for others? If only the self, then it would be wrong for
one, having observed only the body of a being, to use the verbal
convention of his name with respect to it. If 'person' can be
used for other things than the self, it could also be used for
the viewer of forms and so forth. Though such would be allowable,
it would be pointless to assert a further self. (314)</P>

<P><I>10 Positing the view of self</I></P>

<P>It is not feasible for the view of self to be virtuous because
it is especially produced in the obscured, is generated without
application of effort, generates fear with respect to liberation,
and is seen to nourish faults such as desire. Being non-virtuous,
the view of a self is erroneous and mistaken with respect to its
referent object, in which case one cannot prove the existence
of self through citing the existence of the view of self. Furthermore,
it is not feasible for the view of selflessness to be non-virtuous
because the Omniscient Buddha spoke highly of it and because it
must be achieved with great effort, does not generate fear with
respect to liberation, causes the speedy attainment of auspicious
fruits, and acts as the antidote of faults. (314)</P>

<P>Is it that a substantially existent self abides as an objective
reality and thus through its power the view of self is generated,
or is it that whereas the person lacks substantial existence,
the existence of a substantially existent self is superimposed
through the power of conditioning to improper thought? If the
former, then it would follow that Buddhists could not generate
ascertainment of selflessness because this view of self, which
would be produced by the power of the thing itself, would prevent
it. If the latter, then it cannot be proved that a substantially
existent self exists by way of citing the existence of the view
of self. (314, 315)</P>

<P>In brief, a person which is not imputed in dependence upon
the collection, continuum, and so forth of the mental and physical
aggregates does not inherently exist because of not being established
as one nature with or a different nature from the aggregates.
However, the opposite, the substantial existence of the self,
is believed due to the assumption that the self exists validly
as it appears to the innate false view of the transitory collection
as a real I. To such an innate false view the self only appears
to be a different object from the aggregates, for one seeks to
leave these aggregates and gain others that are better than these
but does not wish to leave the self. (315)</P>

<P>When the substantial existence of the person is refuted, one
understands implicitly that the person only imputedly exists.
A mere person must be asserted on the positive side, and mere
imputation is to be realized through the implicit force of refuting
substantial existence. Thus, although self (<I>dtman, bdag</I>)
and person (<I>pudgala, gang zag</I>) are <I>in general </I>synonyms,
they are not synonyms in the expression 'selflessness of the person';
in this context, the term 'self' refers to substantial existence
(<I>dravyasat, rdzas yod</I>), whereas the term 'person' refers
to the nominally existent sentient being imputed to the mental
and physical aggregates. Though some Buddhist Vaibhdshika systems
(exemplified by some modern-day Theravadins) assert that there
is no agent, only action, Dzong-ka-ba says that they are mistakenly
opposing worldly conventionalities. The fact that a substantially
existent agent cannot be found does not mean that person or agent
do not exist at all; they exist imputedly and effectively. (315)
