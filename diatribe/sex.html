two of her schoo</FONT><A HREF="http://www.theshop.net/oska90/Tiffany_Rebecca_Tull.htm"

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">l mates at Little Axe, Oklahoma,
on a countryside cruise. Little Axe is a small rural town near
Lake Thunderbird, about 40 miles southwest of OKC. Her two friends,
Thomas Loveless and Michael Foldenauer, were a little older than
her, maybe seventeen. Tiffany's mom had just called. She was running
errands in town and would be home within an hour. Too late. In
that time the boys pulled into Tiffany's drive way.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">They had been cruisin'
for awhile before Tiffany joined them; two other girls had just
escaped by locking themselves in a convenience store bathroom.
Tiffany, too, had an opportunity to escape at a convenience store
later that evening. She pleaded with the cashier to call 911,
&quot;They have a gun. I'm afraid.&quot; she told him. Tough luck.
The cashier was Vietnamese - as intimidated by the language as
she was by the gun. Instead, he later called his sister to call
911, again too late. The trio left the store and landed in a vacant
two story house near Oklahoma City. There the boys took turns
with Tiffany upstairs. When Michael went up, he found her crying,
naked from the waist down. He testified later that he merely talked
with her for the hour that was to be his turn. When his turn was
over, Thomas returned and shot her in the chest and neck with
a shot gun and several times at point blank with a .22 caliber
pistol, then threw her from the second story window onto the ground
below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The medical examiner testified
that she was clinically alive for some time after that. Life will
leave a fifteen year old only reluctantly. She lay for hours that
final night - to take in the warmth of the Oklahoma autumn, the
smells, the sounds, the pain, the horror, the shock of powerful
passion.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Psychoanalysists have long cashed
in on the power of sex</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">,
called &quot;libido,&quot; and linking its suppression to all
forms of neurosis and strange behaviors. And, to an extent, they
are quite right, for the libido is power - it is the creative
power of universe which cannot be suppressed, only diverted. But
the theory is only half true: the libido is not solely sexual.
It is the combination of two component and complementary forces
- attraction and repulsion; positive and negative; yin and yang,
etc. These together comprise the powers of electromagnetics and
all subsequent manifestations of the unive<IMG SRC="yinyang.JPG"
WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="75" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2">rse.
Small wonder our consciousness is not immune to them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Basically, we are attracted
to pleasure; we do not want pain. But in our limited consciousness,
we regard various objects as eliciting pleasure and pain based
on our own habits and extensive conditioning. These are our predilictions
and prejudices. They are like spells whereby we are unable to
see the object clearly, but only as depicted by this spell. We
are deceived. Others may make use of spells to seduce us, to be
captured in a web of our own desire. More often we deceive ourself
- becoming attracted to and exerting great effort at obtaining
an object which ultimately may bring us greater suffering; or,
in our narrow and immediate self-interest, we neglect or reject
those things which would ultimately provide our greatest happiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In our tendency to isolate
and dissect things we take these forces to be independent of one
another, and to exist independently in subject or object. If I,
for example, find you attractive, I may assume that attraction
to exist somewhere in you. The power that is inherent in attraction
- as in its primal force - is identified with you. And as a result,
I may try to possess you as a way of reaping that power. And if
I cannot possess you, then perhaps I must annihilate you as a
way of overpowering it. In their extreme, attraction and repulsion
lose distinction. Then such things as rape-murder, battered wives,
and murder-suicide are possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Attraction and repulsion
are relationships: they imply a minimum of two objects. They are
not inherent to any one object, but exist interdependently. If
they existed solely in the object, why aren't all things attracted
to that object? If your dream man or woman goes walking about
in a forest, all the little critters will scatter and hide as
if death stalks them. Conversely, if attraction or repulsion exist
solely in the subject, then why are you not attracted to all things,
or averse to all things? These powers do not derive from either
subject nor object in isolation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Neither are they independent
entities, like sin or demons: lust and anger; ira and cupiditas
of Christian theology or Gyalpo and Senmo of Tibetan depictions.
Sometimes when we are consumed by lust or anger, we feel these
forces to be something real, formidable and tenacious: as an enemy
with whom we must do battle. But in their nature they are only
the creative energy of the universe: it is our own mind that transforms
them into lust and anger, and attributes them to objects. They
are fundamental forces that course through the universe, flow
through a consciousness and are expressed as either attraction
or repulsion: like or dislike. They are not stable, not static,
but forever pulsing. Thus, what you dislike today, may become
preferable tomorrow. But in their extreme forms, they become isolated
and static: Attraction becomes attachment and repulsion becomes
fear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Again, these are complementary.
If I am attached to something, I become afraid of losing it; or
if I am afraid of losing something, I become more attached. I
may try to hold on to it more tightly, perhaps constraining it,
or putting it in a fence, securing it with locks and alarms and
various taboos. This we may try to do with persons, or with things.
Even with our planet. We divy it up, put a fence around that part
of our planet that is &quot;mine.&quot; We ward off intruders
with guns, maybe poison the insects and critters that trespass;
we block the wind and hold back the soil. This is our &quot;domain&quot;
- local power - power over fear. It is fear that we try to hold
back, ward away, and hide. Fear of the unknown, of tomorrow. In
vain we try to hold on to what we have today, for ultimately,
how much land does one person need? About 4 feet by 7 feet by
6 feet deep into which others can throw your mortal remains. Or
you can choose to be cremated: your ashes blown by the winds upon
the hillsides to be washed by rain to the oceans where it feeds
the plankton which respire to all breathing things. This is another
way to die; it is also another way to live. But to most of us,
this is our greatest fear - of losing oneself; the fear of annhiliation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Strangely, this is also
our greatest attraction: the orgasmic bliss of sexual union. In
this there is the momentary release from one's own isolation,
a melting of boundaries and barriers, a merging with a being quite
outside of oneself. For some creatures - notably insects - the
moment of sexual union is also its death: to drown in the water
where one's eggs are laid, or to be eaten by one's own lover.
But even where we survive such union, we are temporarily released
- annihilated - from our own tired and customary habits and ideas.
Therein lies fulfillment, joy, satisfaction and happiness. This
is the moment of love.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The moment of sex we call
&quot;making love,&quot; indicating it is a composition of factors
leading to this orgasmic release. Yet it is only temporary. We
might become so attached to this feeling that we try to repeat
the experience, soliciting it in various ways trying to duplicate
that initial high. It might become an addiction in itself. We
might exhibit various accoutrements, imagined scenarios, roles
and postures. We may have a ravenous appetite for new experiences
and partners, all indicating the very elusive nature of our goal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Or we may resign ourself
to this ephemeral nature of love, and settle into a routine but
stable relationship in which we may &quot;mature as individuals.&quot;
Those experiences of love - of merging, melting, expanding - we
felt earlier are forgotten or dismissed: e.g., &quot;puppy love&quot;;
or &quot;falling in love,&quot; as a rite of passage for two people
in developing a more mature form of mutual trust and dependence.
There is a residual bond between two or more people, but one's
own isolation gradually returns, i.e., the honeymoon is over.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Simply by viewing the
way things work, it is a wonder we do not love as our normal experience
and feel isolated and alone as anomoly. The water which comprises
the bulk of our physical being is the same water that comprised
the primordial soup. Passing from sea to cloud to rain to river
to this being that being, it continues to pass through us and
on again. The air that I breathe now was a moment ago in your
blood. Now I release again to whomever needs it. Our emotions
are our common chemistry; our thoughts form from the language
and culture we share. How is it then that we judge love to be
elusive and illusive, and not our isolation? This is because of
attachment and fear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">As love is to attachment, so wisdom
is to fear. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Once we
are burnt by an open flame, it is wisdom that keeps one's hands
away. But this is not the same as fear. Once we recognize that
fire burns, we do not need to burn ourself, rather we can use
it to produce work - e.g., internal combustion engines or a variety
of industrial processes. Where love embraces and finds similarity
in things; wisdom examines and makes distinctions. Where love
is the ground, wisdom is the path. Wisdom is the pivotal force
of freedom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Love and Wisdom are not
opposites, but like attachment and fear, they are two sides of
the same coin. These two coins can be contrasted along the dimension
of open or closed. Love and wisdom are open, free, natural; whereas
attachment and fear are closed, controlled and contrived.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Wisdom seeks to avoid
suffering, and transcendent wisdom seeks to avoid the cause of
that suffering, which must also include attachment and fear. Wisdom
will tell you that if you love, it is possible your heart will
be broken; if you are generous, someone may take advantage of
you. And even so, it is better than attachment and fear. Living
inside attachment and fear is like cornering yourself off in a
small chamber of a vast mansion. From inside this little room
you might imagine and project all kinds of things outside, and
these become your chamber walls. Nonetheless, inside or outside,
it is all your mansion: all your home. Overcoming attachment and
fear feels a lot like coming home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A similar distinction
could be made along the dimension of time: love and wisdom are
grounded in the present moment; attachment is grounded in the
past; and fear is grounded in the future. A person has no power
over events or things of the past, although they hold power over
him as distraction, hostility or regret. Fear of anticipated or
unknown events in the future cause tension, shutting down or covering
up - the mind is often just set on stun. There is no power over
the past or future. All power is in the present, this moment.
The moment is like a street light that protects the mind from
the darkness of ignorance: from the thugs of fear and theives
of attachment. The moment is the ocean where all streams converge;
the space where all phenomena arise. The power of the present
moment lies in &quot;being present&quot; or having a presence.
Anything that takes you out of the present is taking away your
power. Therefore, a method for developing love and wisdom - and
personal power - is to remain present in the immediacy of each
moment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Related to attachment
and fear is hope. Hope, like fear, is grounded in the future,
but it is a form of attachment. We can get too attached to even
love and wisdom in hope for some imagined future happening. Wisdom
tells us that sometimes things are open, sometimes things are
closed. When the diaphragm opens, air fills the lungs like a bellows.
When it closes, air is pushed out along with body toxins. To hold
it open, or to hold it closed, is risky. The mind, like the breath,
must also be free and natural not controlled or contrived. We
should not be attached to being open, nor afraid of being closed.
That said, given that our consciousness likes to latch on to things
and get stuck, we sometimes require a gentle nudge to return it
to the present. This nudge is not a rejection or suppression.
It is opening again to the moment, to its manifold options. And
it should be gentle - don't get upset when consciousness is gone
again, more hope and fear. Patience and generosity are the attributes
of love and wisdom. So also is diligence. Gradually the mind begins
to open easier and more fully.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;So what does all
this have to do with sex?&quot; you may be asking, &quot;When
will we get to the good stuff?&quot; Sorry. You may be at the
wrong web site. What I want to do is make clear that sex is power
and, like atomic power, it can be either fusion or fission: you
can merge, melt, brighten, enlighten; or divide, pollute and blow
up the place. In its lowest form sex is violence waged against
another human being. In its highest, it is a spiritual practice.
In the highest yogas, love and wisdom are again transformed -
exchanged for another coin - bliss and emptiness (- beyond our
scope here). Sex deserves respect. It should be approached with
love and wisdom.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Modern society links maturity to
conquest and violence. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A
boy passes into manhood by stealing the girlhood from the woman,
or by beating the boyhood from other boys. This is taught by the
entertainment industry, of course, but primarily by parents and
schools. We catalog human history by invasion and dominance, as
if this is the march of human civilization. In truth humanity
advanced in civilization considerably in spite of such machismo.
While war might form an exchange of cultures and merchandise prior
to the rise of markets, in the usual case it destroyed civilization,
subjugated people, looted merchants, pillaged communities, raped
women, demolished libraries and temples. Why treat the warrior
as a hero, when in fact he is more villain. If someone were to
do as he did in your neighborhood, you'd call the police! Yet
in school we teach kids this is how humanity matures, by soldiers:
not scientists, artists, philosophers, and mystics. In terms of
advancing civilization, the mystics far exceeded the warrior or
merchant. Even more so did the lowly housewife (see below). Is
it a wonder that kids return to school in camouflage and with
semi-automatic rifles? They return to roost; reap what we sow.
History could be taught as reliably by changing words like &quot;conquer&quot;
to &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;rule&quot; to &quot;oppress&quot;
as the book is printed. It catalogs the same historic event, but
says something different. This is so obvious it shouldn't need
mention.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In primitive cultures,
a boy passes into adulthood by a rite of passage called a &quot;vision
quest&quot; or something like it. It is not an effort to conquer
or destroy anything or anybody else. You don't need guns or a
lot of equipment - in fact, less is definitely more. It is a training
in the mastery over attachment and fear. By conquering his own
narrow and immature views, a boy becomes an adult in full standing
in the community. Given the power of passions in adolescents -
and the availability of guns - it may be prudent to be more primitive
in this respect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A boy dropped off on a
mountain side, alone with a week's provisions - deprived of entertainment,
news, sports, and friends as framed-in reference - may notice
the expansive night sky, the way the earth orbits the sun, how
clouds form from mountain glaciers. He may notice a wonderous
silence - open, free and natural - and how small his ideas about
himself had been. He may begin to question his own mortality and
purpose. And in this sense of awe and doubt there is an opening
within himself. If he can stay with it, fully grounded in the
moment, and not run away - for all kinds of fear will try to fill
the hollow - nor hide in cleverness, he will come down the mountain
a lot wiser than when he went up. Traditionally, this is not a
ritual the girl would take - I guess childbearing was enough.
But we may consider our time, if not modern or post-modern, at
least neo-primitive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">A distinguishing feature of neo-primitive
society</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> is demographic:
people live longer, take longer to mature, and have fewer children.
On the one hand this bodes well. People can take their time and
really mature such qualities of love and wisdom before committing
the horrible mistakes in sex and marriage we sometimes observe.
Moreover, there is more time after the children have grown, giving
more possibilities to an even greater maturity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">On the other hand, fewer
children mean a dissolution of the husband/wife familial bond.
Single mothers, homosexual and bisexual relationships have become
prominant in recent years. The role of women is changing. Culturally
and historically, the woman has been subordinate to the man by
her role in child bearing and rearing. Reproduction vs production;
shadow-work, unpaid or underpaid, as housemaker or secretary -
the woman has always held a vital but undervalued role in human
history. Freed from the chore of child bearing, she now wants
equal recognition and equal duties in the trenches and in the
board rooms. That's only fair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But something subtle has
been lost. Subtle, because for millennia it has been in the shadow
of the male conquests. The woman - especially the matriarchal
household - has long been the civilizing force of society. In
the Westward Ho! of the American frontier, it was the woman who
established churches and schoolhouses in the wake of the men's
brothels and saloons. This on the basis of her need for stability
and security - and civility - in raising kids. The moralists recognize
this. They want a return to family values. To this end, they would
end public support of single mothers; scorn homosexuality; and
cheer large families. But this is the logic of attachment and
fear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We are facing an extraordinary
evolution in human society. Only love and wisdom can face this
change constructively. There is no one working in the shadows
to make it good - except for a few mystics, and one can see in
the papers it is beginning to overwhelm them. Make no mistake:
Love and wisdom are acts of courage. Whether standing in the protest
line or check-out line at your local grocery store, if you are
standing there with love and wisdom, in that moment you are a
hero. And you are standing with the truly great heros of human
civilization: from Jesus and Socrates, Abraham Lincoln and Martin
Luther King, Jr, Mahatma Gandhi, Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->.
These men gave their lives to civilization. And civilization still
vibrates with their lives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Now, relax. You may not
have to die for love and wisdom; but you should be prepared to
give your life for them. Mother Theresa gave her life for love
and wisdom; also, <A HREF="http://www.newciv.org/worldtrans/whole/bucky.html"
TARGET="_top">Buckminster Fuller</A>. When Bucky Fuller was in
his 20's he pondered suicide. Then in a stroke of genius, he decided
that rather than taking his life he would give it to humanity.
And for the next 50 or so years, he devoted his life to designing
tools humanity would need in the future. They were not exactly
marketable; probably none went into mass production. That was
not his intention. Sometime in the future, he thought, humanity
would need these tools: He was solely motivated for the well being
of others.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Heroes come in all shapes
and sizes: in how you raise your kids; how you drive your car;
conduct a business. It is a heroic gesture to speak words of understanding
and encouragement when the room is filled with slander and sarcasm.
It is heroic to let a column of cars behind you slow for a merging
one in front. Forget your fifteen minutes of fame; just be a hero
for one moment. Do it for the planet. Do it for your children.
Do it for Tiffany Tull.</FONT></P>
