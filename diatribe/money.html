    <P>Humanity has experienced a perturbation in its long evolution
    of social development. This is not the result of one man, army,
    wealth or idea, but the interaction and exchange of many communities
    - once isolated and introspective, suddenly opened and expanded.
    It is a society based on exchange.</P>

    <P>Money - the medium of exchange - is the social fabric of this
    new age. The medium itself is a consensus of many players, expanding
    through time and across generations, and in day-to-day interaction,
    to the point where now it is almost regarded as scientific, a
    natural component of our solar system or inherent to humankind.
    But it is inherent to society, and by understanding what we mean
    by money, we may gain some understanding of the modern age.</P>

    <P>Because money is also endowed with values far removed from
    the simple facilitation of exchange, our discussion will address
    multiple dimensions of our topic. We will begin with a brief
    historical placement of money, tracing its evolving nature through
    the accumulated knowledge of man., and then draw political, social
    and psychological implications, followed by more whimsical speculation.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">HISTORICITY</FONT></B></P>

    <P>Evolving by the invention of hominids, and their ability to
    conceive and formulate, money represents an exchange medium common
    to all forms of human aggregation and organization throughout
    time and location. The conception of &quot;what it is&quot; has
    varied, but &quot;that it is&quot; has continued from neolithic
    times.</P>

    <P>Money could be anything of agreed-value: a residual in the
    consumption of goods or services which remains liquid - i.e.,
    that which can be passed on. In a barter of two goods - say,
    corn for pork, or pork for work - any inequality of exchange
    could be matched by a token of agreed significance, as, perhaps,
    an IOU for later redemption. Depending on the level of social
    organization, the token may remain liquid-- i.e., perpetuated
    through subsequent trades, between two or many others.</P>

    <P>Money could be represented by shells, stones, or commodities.
    The common characteristic is some socially recognized value.
    As social organizations evolved and inter-exchanged, a common
    medium - e.g., metal specie (like gold) - was invested with an
    understood value for exchange. The commonality of this medium
    enabled the expansion and sophistication of social exchange,
    thus extending the spatial dimensions of trade and social interactions.
    To regulate this value and deter counterfeiting, power to inscribe
    value to the exchange medium was assumed by a central authority.
    This power, in turn, reinforced the political institutions of
    the day. Through inscription, money could be valued above the
    specie content owing to the value of the symbols inscribed.</P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Seigniorage </FONT></B>(the difference
    between the exchange value of money and the cost of producing
    and maintaining it) and the debasement of currency represented
    a profit to the issuing authority. From this profit, the central
    government could exchange for its own purposes: such as cathedrals;
    luxury for rulers; or military expenditures. Paul Einzig writes
    that Cleopatra devalued the <I>drachma</I> by seventy-five percent
    to finance her life of luxury, for example, and Charles the Bad
    debased his country's coinage by one-third in 1383, with the
    object of securing funds to celebrate the release of the hier
    to the throne from French captivity. (Bretton, 1980)</P>

    <P>Money can also be a democratizing force, depending upon its
    distribution. In a strict one man-one vote democracy, no man
    assumes greater power than any other, but in an inequitable distribution
    of money, those possessing greater amounts effectively possess
    more votes in market development, as well as political decisions.
    Norman Angell stresses that the Greeks, &quot;to whom more than
    to any other people, the western world owes democracy, were the
    first fully to democratize money (or, perhaps, be democratized
    by it); to make its use common with the ordinary man, and to
    impose upon it public control for the public benefit.&quot; Angell
    also stressed the political significance of inscription.</P>

    <P>Money was clearly politicized by the eighth-century, B.C.
    Money, tied to political systems, ebbed with the same. There
    was relatively little in way of an aggregate system after the
    Roman era, until the arrival of the Spanish and Portuguese looting
    expeditions of central America. It is interesting how the influx
    of specie could effect social and economic institutions. Keynes
    linked the flowering of the European renaissance and the establishment
    of the modern monetary system with the arrival of Drake's booty.
    Similarly, Stadnichenko, a leading Soviet economist, links the
    dissolution of feudalism with the issuance of paper money in
    Europe - also coinciding with Drake's arrival. (Bretton, 1980)</P>

    <P>In spite of these social transformations and the saturation
    of monetary exchange, the economic and social systems were still
    not comparable to those of the present day. Coinciding with the
    period of new world colonialisation., there was an apparent confusion
    concerning wealth and exchange. Known as &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Mercantilism</FONT>&quot;,
    the economic belief of the time was that each nation should hoard
    as much of the precious specie as possible, in a. scramble to
    obtain a dominant position within the world political arena.
    International trade was seen as a leakage of the precious medium,
    and so was held to a minimum. The result-- though increasing
    the value of national currency-- was internal depression.</P>

    <P>This time represents an extreme depiction of the politicalization
    of monetarized wealth. It also depicts the case where, rather
    than facilitating exchange, the medium became held as superior
    to exchange. This is an important quality for our understanding
    of money-- it assumes a value as something above that of medium.
    Our economic conception becomes transformed.</P>

    <P>We find the limits to avarice emerging as early as 1660 in
    a report of the H.M. Council of Trade in London. The principle
    point is that the export or import of bullion depends upon the
    balance of trade. Prohibitions cannot prevent the export but
    may, in effect, hinder the import. Sir <FONT COLOR="#00ff00">William
    Petty</FONT>, at about the same period, also observed that the
    prohibition of exports was futile. Both goods and money flow
    according to their relative prices at each location. But even
    Petty reverts to Mercantilism.</P>

    <P>By the end of the seventeenth century, economic analysis began
    taking a modern form. It was <FONT COLOR="#00ff00">David Hume</FONT>,
    in 1741, who combined the thought into a rational series of essays.
    Behind his thought was the accumulated knowledge assembled in
    Britain: the quantity theory of money; the recognition that excess
    trade balances tend to produce specie flows; the doctrine that
    the world's supply of specie is distributed more or less automatically;
    the doctrine of the effect of exchange rate movements upon prices--
    Hume merely drove the point home. Money is &quot;none of the
    wheels of trade&quot;. Money is only &quot; a method of enumeration,
    a set of counters&quot;. In foreign trade it becomes a disadvantage,
    since an increase will simply raise prices of products and production,
    including labor. It is only in the interim between the increased
    quantity of gold and silver and the resulting increase in prices
    that social production is actually benefited. <FONT COLOR="#00ffff">&quot;Things
    resume their previous relationships, except that more counters
    are used.&quot; (Angell, 1926)</FONT></P>

    <P>It was <FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Adam Smith</FONT>, who was historically
    recognized for the overthrow of Mercantilism, although he, himself,
    attributes his thought to Hume. Smith, on the one hand, attributes
    flexibility of prices to the relative abundance of goods. On
    the other hand, he suggests value being determined by relative
    labor costs. His central contribution lay in his demonstration
    of the reciprocal advantages arising from the international division
    of labor, yet even this contribution was derived from an earlier
    discussion by Hume. Ultimately, we may assert that the demise
    of Mercantilism lay in the realization that the kinetic-- or
    flow - value of money was greater than the potential - or hoarded
    - value.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">INFORMATION THEORY</FONT></B></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P>If we adjust the word &quot;medium&quot; to mean &quot;message&quot;,
    we may study our subject with the help of information theory.
    In information theory, there is talk of &quot;positive-feedback&quot;
    and &quot;negative-feedback&quot; - the former relating to &quot;<FONT
     COLOR="#00ff00">self-amplifying, or self destroying organizations
    or situations</FONT>&quot;, the latter to internal stability.
    The difference between the two is a multiplication factor, which,in
    the case of positive-feedback, has some value sufficiently different
    from unity (i.e., 1.0) to have an accumulative effect, and,in
    the case of negative-feedback, has some value approximating unity,
    so that the system tends to equilibrium (for static systems )
    or steady-state (for dynamic systems). In a feedback sense, money
    is idealized as a feedback signal relating to the productive
    forces of society (i.e., money flows to socially productive behaviors),
    guiding the system through some stable growth path. But, because
    of other qualities inherent in our medium, the signal becomes
    distorted.</P>

    <P>We may think of the present monetary investment in status
    goods, national armaments, real estate and other speculative
    holdings - e.g., gold - as examples of unproductive objects of
    present concern. Each has the obvious &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ff00">opportunity
    costs</FONT>&quot;. National armaments - although rationalized
    in terms of employment, technological innovation and protection
    of its citizenry from the <I>other </I>warlord - ultimately divert
    investment from possibly more lasting and socially benefiting
    production and, if ever employed, would surely disrupt international
    markets and national concerns. Real estate and gold are competitive
    (though less fluid) exchange mediums which, when speculated against
    national currency, typically devalue monetary holdings. These
    investments also divert investment in capital formation and social
    welfare. That these alternative mediums devalue currency may
    be an error-signal in its own right. Monetary value is largely
    a value of confidence. Where confidence is lacking -- as in an
    inflationary economy -- there is an increased turnover - or,
    &quot;velocity&quot; - of currency in favor of these alternate
    holdings. This results in an amplification process characteristic
    of positive- feedback, known to us as <FONT COLOR="#00ff00" SIZE="+1">r</FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#00ff00">unaway inflation</FONT>.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF
    KINETIC ABSTRACTION</FONT></B></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P>To better understand this kinetic-- or &quot;medium&quot;--
    value of money, let us consider the point where value is introduced
    beyond the embodied commodity-value. This value remains &quot;liquid&quot;--
    principally intangible and social. We will begin our analysis
    with a barter exchange of two commodities, and then introduce
    a monetary fluidity.</P>

    <P>Let us envision a Farmer Dale and an Old MacDonald. Farmer
    Dale has a bumper crop of corn; Old Mac's sow had a litter of
    pigs. Old Mac would like to feed sweet corn to his pigs and proposes
    to Farmer Dale that he will give one of the pigs when fattened
    if he could have some of Farmer Dale's corn. Now, farmers are
    not typically fast talkers and you always know where to find
    them, so Farmer Dale figures he can trust Old Mac.</P>

    <P>How much corn is a pig worth? Here it is an isolated negotiation.
    Farmer Dale values his corn based on his surplus that year. Old
    Mac reckons how much he needs to feed his pigs. How many pigs
    is corn worth? Old Mac figures he can only spare one in exchange
    for feeding the rest. Farmer Dale would like to have another
    for his surplus corn, but Old Mac doesn't want anymore corn than
    what's necessary to feed them. So, although they both have an
    interest in making a trade in the beginning, they reach some
    point at which a trade is no longer attractive. So they bargain
    an amount of corn equal to one fat pig, here denoted as a token
    or document - like an IOU - which can be exchanged for the pig
    when it has grown. The IOU is an expression of money - albeit,
    a limited one - based upon<FONT COLOR="#00ff00"> the now obsolete
    pig standard</FONT>.</P>

    <P>Now envision a community of family farms. Families come in
    all shapes and sizes - some large, some small. Each works over
    a certain parcel of land - originally determined only by how
    much each can work given their relative size - the larger the
    family, the larger the parcel of land - but eventually constrained
    by the expansions of other farms in the area. Over several generations,
    each parcel is divided among the children - having the reverse
    effect, the more children available to work the land, the smaller
    each parcel. Eventually, various rules of inheritance were devised
    to keep such parcels from dwindling to zero - as in the first
    male or female child inheriting the lot, with the others having
    to work for their elder sibling.</P>

    <P>Farming is a vulnerable occupation - seasonal, but also varies
    year to year depending on unpredictable natural forces, like
    rainfall. Some families - due to their relative size and performance
    - have a greater bumper - a storage from prior harvests; others
    are precariously perched at the edge of subsistence. The weaker
    families approach the more powerful ones for loans in exchange
    for future harvests. Again a form of money is exchanged - a symbol
    of future harvests in exchange for past ones. Still, however,
    the negotiation is local and personal.</P>

    <P>The revolutionary value of tokens for exchange - the IOUs
    as opposed to the actual product - is that they are portable
    and impersonal. They can be easily transported from one community
    of farms to another, allowing trade between regions. Thereby,
    the family that accumulates them may exchange with other communities
    in the region, favoring their relative position locally and consummating
    their position as &quot;lord.&quot; Eventually, such tokens lose
    all reference to a particular harvest or pig, but became values
    solely on the basis of exchange. As tokens evolved and their
    use expanded - as between regions and finally nations - they
    also affect the nature of trade itself.</P>

    <P>This money which makes up the <FONT COLOR="#00ff00">balance
    of trade</FONT>, can be seen to represent a claim against its
    issuer's future product. Under a bullion standard it could be
    exchanged for specie. A currency's value was determined by the
    volume in circulation relative to its bullion reserve. Assuming
    a degree of confidence in that reserve, exchange for specie is
    actually seldom done-- it being much easier to hold and exchange
    currency. The difficulty arises, however, that the value of a
    currency also fluctuates according to its relative abundance
    abroad. Hence, a secondary market arose: the speculation of currencies.</P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ff00">In a laissez-faire market system</FONT>,
    competitive markets arise where each currency is exchanged for
    every other currency until a single price obtains between every
    possible combination of currencies. These prices will be stabilized
    not only within each market, but also between them. If the price
    of British sterling per dollar were lower in New York than in
    London, for example, all buyers of sterling would buy in New
    York, thus bidding up the prices, and all sellers would sell
    in London, thus reducing the prices, until prices in both areas
    equalized.</P>

    <P>Although the laissez-faire system would establish uniform
    and orderly exchange rates throughout the world, the relative
    prices would not necessarily remain stable. This is seen in the
    case of a deficit balance of trade where either specie or currency
    is spent abroad to balance the trade. This would result in raising
    the relative prices of the other currencies against the one,
    or depreciating the one against the others.</P>

    <P>One thing the bullion standard did was to offer a common denominator
    to monetary exchange. Since its abandonment, the value of a currency
    is a function of exchange rates and arbitrage. Aside from speculation,
    its value is also a function of confidence-- i.e., that it can
    be converted into a commodity. Ungrounded, money returns to abstraction:
    a set of counters used to quantify &quot;productive possibilities&quot;.
    The possession of money thus implies a claim against these possibilities.
    Its value is determined chiefly by the number of counters relative
    to the wealth it quantifies. But, as Hume acknowledged, at least
    for the interim period, social production is befitted by the
    influx of more counters. <FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Wealth itself,
    then, is a fluid and intangible process.</FONT></P>

    <P>If wealth is an abstraction - a value added by the production
    process, not pre-existing in latent form - then its stock can
    be expanded. If it exists as given - as in fixed and nonrenewable
    global resources - then it can only be transferred and we must
    assume the ordinary opportunity costs. Thus, following an expansion
    of currency, there is a point of saturation where the further
    issuance only raises prices. But by pacing the release of more
    currency, we may further raise our productive possibilities over
    time. The national monetary board has the duty of regulating
    the currency so as to enable a steady-growth path. That it can
    be expanded indefinitely assumes the ideal character of wealth
    (wealth as process). If we cannot expand it indefinitely, then
    we are only changing its form. Depreciating in the usual way,
    a resource stock devalues over its productive life. <FONT COLOR="#00ff00">Production
    may, at once, exert a positive and a negative effect on wealth.</FONT>
    If there is a net gain, it is the value of human work.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT</FONT></B></P>

    <P>Exchange occurs within a social setting. It involves the product
    of labor which is more than a variable in a production function.
    The value added is an organized application of intelligent life.
    Where the exchange medium becomes fluid, political and abstract,
    it is sure to have social consequences. By its commonality and
    non-perishable properties, the individual is given new freedoms
    in the choice of social and economic ties. This has led to the
    ego-centering of economic processes.</P>

    <P>During the Middle Ages, it was culture or tradition - not
    the market - which regulated economic activity. Both peasant
    and lord accepted the customs because they served the purposes
    of each. The lord could count on them reinforcing his rule and
    income. The peasant could appeal to them for justice within the
    social setting. Rent in the sense of payment in money or in-kind
    for the use of land was a small part of the tenurial relations
    between lord and his peasants and the payments were not unidirectional.
    The lord's wealth was as much determined by the number of his
    men as by the amount of land he controlled. The peasants could
    expect in turn the provision of goods and services, a share of
    the wealth in boon periods, and stability of political form.
    The lord was more a leader than a landlord. The concept of land
    &quot;ownership&quot; was not present in Medieval society. In
    medieval law, land was held by one member in the hierarchy for
    a superior member. If we go back to the 12th century, the <FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff">&quot;dominant concepts were not ownership and
    incomes, rents and profits, but lordship, tenure and service.
    &quot;(Cohen, et al 1975)</FONT></P>

    <P>Social customs were also enforced by the peasant culture.
    Work groups were often formed on the basis of kinship and neighborhood.
    Social integration was served by the distribution system. May
    Diaz informs us that the dyadic contract-- fictive kin, friend
    or neighborhood ties-- <FONT COLOR="#00ffff">&quot;is established
    and reinforced with gift-giving and the exchange of favors and
    services, thus increasing the flow and magnitude of the local
    economy just as Christmas gift-giving spurs on distribution in
    the United States.&quot; (Potter, et al, 1967)</FONT> This encourages
    the employment of resources toward the social good, in what Diaz
    terms a <FONT COLOR="#00ffff">&quot;give now, to draw later...
    elementary, low-risk savings system.&quot; (Ibid)</FONT></P>

    <P>What led to the shift in relations was the enclosure of land
    into private possession. What led to enclosure was a new exchange
    mechanism - money. Rents need no longer be paid in surplus produce,
    but can be paid by taxing profits. Service to the lord was no
    longer customary obligation but could be settled with wages.
    All units of production could be assigned monetary value, exchanged,
    :and devoted to profit-maximizing activities. The landlord came
    more and more to view land as a source of income, and men as
    potential wage-earners. The lords expelled peasants from their
    traditional holdings and claimed the agricultural surplus. According
    to Marx, this surplus served as the primary source of primitive
    capital accumulation and formed the basis for the capitalist
    mode of production In the Marxian framework, the expelled peasantry
    became the wage-labor work force, which gave rise to the industrial
    proletariat.(Cohen, et al 1975)</P>

    <P>Illich tells us that the <FONT COLOR="#00ffff">&quot;abhorrence
    of wage-labor still fits the outlook which might be shared by
    today's world majority&quot; (Illich, 1980)</FONT></P>

    <P>Illich provides historical examples of this awkward transition.
    Until the mid-eighteenth century, &quot;French poor houses were
    run on the medieval Christian assumption that forced labor was
    a punishment for sin or crime.&quot; In other areas, chiefly
    Protestant Europe, workhouses were organized and equipped to
    cure laziness and develop the will for work. The main population,
    however, resisted such attempts for &quot;improvement&quot;.</P>

    <P>Not everything could be monetarized, obviously. Those unquantified
    aspects of the modern system Illich terms &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ffff">shadow-work</FONT>&quot;,
    composed principally by the &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ffff">domestic
    enclosure of women</FONT>&quot;. This was to become a &quot;<FONT
     COLOR="#00ffff">necessary complement to the production of goods
    and services</FONT>.&quot; By making working men into the wardens
    of their domestic women, and this guardianship a burdensome duty,
    the enclosure of women made wage-work a &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ffff">necessary
    adjunct of life</FONT>.&quot; The shadow-economy includes more
    than housewives, however. Much of it represents various barter
    transactions or &quot;barn-raising&quot; activities. In the United
    States, this economy was valued at approximately $700 billion
    in 1980 - more than a quarter of the GNP value were it monetarized.(Wall
    Street Journal, 1980) When the monetary economy does poorly,
    as it did then, the shadow-economy becomes stronger. We were
    informed that &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ffff">all around the world,
    ten thousands of movements try to unplug their communities from
    both wage and shadow-work through the choice of alternative use-value
    oriented lifestyles,... Sweden might now be leading the world
    in the attempt to employ disciplined shadow-workers (volunteers)
    in its social services .... This is a plan to make shadow-work
    in the social sector increase much faster than wage- labour.
    &quot; (Illich, 1980)</FONT></P>

    <P>We should expect a reluctance on the part of our national
    and economic interests to dispense with wage-labor. The 'L' in
    the economic production function represents labor, which can
    be priced according to its marginal contribution to production.
    Its surplus income becomes savings which then can be reinvested
    in capital formation. By the reduction of man into these mathematical
    operations, our social organization again becomes stable and
    predictable. Further, it becomes profitable. Profit remains a
    national concern. With taxable income, governments may finance
    their defense and public goods. Defense and public goods are
    necessary to instill confidence in social institutions, which
    is necessary to maintain the positions of power and social order.</P>

    <P>We are thus led to the dialectic of the individual and society.
    In Marxist thought <FONT COLOR="#00ffff">&quot;man by his activity,
    creates an order of external relations which appear to his descendants
    as destiny; but in reality a situation is never definitive, it
    is always being remade both by the gaze which contemplates it
    and by the will which transcends it.&quot;(Aron, 1929)</FONT>
    National wealth - comprised of enclosed properties, capital accumulation,
    and accumulated knowledge - stand external to the person. The
    traditions and the family farm is replaced by the university
    and the urban economy of specialized functions. Commonwealth
    becomes privatized and exclusive. Its processes become remote
    and elaborate.</P>

    <P>The Marxists postulate a &quot;privileged state&quot; which
    would render meaning to all of history. This privileged state
    was described in terms of &quot;homogeneous society or mutual
    recognition.&quot; Merleau-Ponty decreed that only the proletariat
    was capable of achieving this &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ffff">privileged
    state</FONT>&quot; by the seizure of power and the construction
    of a collective economy. In his later writings, however, he is
    less optimistic.<FONT SIZE="+1"> </FONT>Merleau-Ponty has Stalinist
    Russia in mind with this acquiescence. But it in no way is so
    limited, e.g., the French Revolution.</P>

    <P>The call to a collective economy is not solely Marxist. Historically,
    it is the rule rather than the exception. In the days of yore,
    however, it was the province of community - the &quot;commonwealth.&quot;
    As community is replaced by society, it is dubbed &quot;socialism.&quot;The
    &quot;ten of thousands of movements&quot; mentioned by Illich
    might well be found in the central cities of western industrial
    nations where the young gentries exemplify community-values,
    or Illich's &quot;<FONT COLOR="#00ffff">use-value life-styles</FONT>&quot;.</P>

    <P>A notable shift has occured in social motivation. In the traditional
    - or simplistic - society, production was for the good of the
    community. Illich finds the modern expression portrayed by the
    protagonists of 19th century European novelists which <FONT COLOR="#00ffff">&quot;live
    in a society that has made it almost impossible to desire, except
    what others whom one envies either have or want. And when these
    protagonists pursue their desires in this fashion, they transmogrify
    their envy into virtue.&quot;(Illich, 1980)</FONT></P>

    <P>For the ambitious and the powerful, money becomes the winnings
    of a well-played game. Money thus offered the promise of &quot;<FONT
     COLOR="#00ff00">betterment</FONT>&quot;. But the unrealistic
    expectation of &quot;betterment&quot; - as in a Great Society
    - only sent inflationary signals through the economy. The notion
    of betterment therefore has been revised - not abandoned - but
    it must be redirected. Wage-income is suppressed - by monetary
    regimen - to hold down inflation; while profit-income is maximized
    - by fiscal policy - to facilitate expansion. The rationale is
    that the economy as a whole is benefited, and to a considerable
    extent that is true - employment has expanded considerably and
    even the sma<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->llest savings can
    find a broker on wall street. Yet <A HREF="surveymost.html" 
    TARGET="main">real wages </A>(the exchange value of wages for
    all other commodities) remains virtually unchanged in 25 years.
    The underlying this schema there is a familiar tone - like the
    French <FONT COLOR="#00ff00">assignat</FONT> - an exchange of
    public debt for private wealth.</P>

    <P>For those of us who have not amassed alternate holdings in
    real estate, who cannot manipulate stock exchanges or development
    policies, we become increasingly dependent on the subtle and
    abstract properties of currencies - representing, in total, all
    of the market's interwoven and changing processes. What, for
    some, is unlimited opportunity, for others becomes only hopeful
    confusion. Exchange rates and stock prices do not respond so
    much to the amortization of government borrowings as they do
    to public uncertainty. Where the system was once founded upon
    individual freedoms and properties, it now needs aggregate summaries
    and corporate entities. For the individual - depending upon his
    sensitivities - there are inner-directedness, indifference, and
    the remnants of humor.</P>

    <P>Hominds are accumulating knowledge of material laws, and the
    properties of systems and processes. We know that this is far
    from perfected. We must yet view even our own knowledge by the
    &quot;gaze which contemplates it and by the will which transcends
    it.&quot;</P>

    <P>Economics poses as a pure science: a system of mathematical
    equations. To the extent that it reduces a population to workers,
    and work to wages, it has subjugated citizens into a resource
    of the production process. Power over the production process
    - and hence, its citizenry - is distributed by monetary flows
    and holdings. Money here denotes contracts over pigs and corn,
    to be sure, but also securities and indentures from the longest
    term bond to the smallest legal tender. Everytime policy is formulated
    solely or primarily by these abstractions of economic calculation,
    power shifts from the citizenry - i.e., democracy - to its money
    - i.e., plutocracy: power distributed on the basis of wealth.</P>

    <P>A polity must provide its society with basic needs for survival.
    Moreover, there is a limit to economic inequality beyond which
    society disintegrates. This limit is not an objective calculable
    percentage, but one of expectations. Beyond a comfortable lifestyle,
    there are always expectations of a better one. Labor may begrudgingly
    work for its bosses - however oppressive they may be perceived
    - provided it has become dependent upon wages. But its output
    may not work quite as well, may be in constant need of repair,
    or face long delays in production. This will weaken its position
    in international exchange - a slow and silent form of sedition.
    Or, a society may erupt into riots and massive looting - the
    legitimacy of the nation-state is rescinded, and its economy,
    toppled. There are many examples of this through the history
    of the world.</P>

    <P>Money has been described as &quot;kinetic abstraction&quot;,
    it has no value in itself - only an assigned value due to the
    wealth it depicts. To the extent that wealth is produced, not
    fixed by natural constraints, it is not someting possessed; it
    cannot be hoarded; but must remain suspended in relationships,
    as in a system for putting-out, and for exchange.</P>

    <P>Economic Man, too, is an abstraction. For he also exists in
    relation. His economic position has social bearing, and political
    aims. To individualize him is to isolate, also sever and disempower.
    The principle of self-interest is not economic. It does not make
    sense in our knowledge of systems. It will come to lose sense
    in our knowledge of economics.</P>

    debasement was used by the governors of the Greek city states,
    as well as by their successors on European thrones, to finance
    self-serving military adventures, including looting expeditions
    into neighboring territories. The rulers issued coins, proceeded
    to shave off or otherwise remove some of the value, and legitimized
    the practice by appropriate decrees designed to encourage the
    public to use the altered coins as though the fraud had not occurred.
    In the course of time, ... in the Greek and Roman republics,
    the coining monopoly drifted into the hands of religious authority....
    Burns identifies money as the engine driving the antagonists
    in the Peloponnesian wars, and debasement as the immediate means
    to augment scarce resources. But to use that means effectively,
    unlimited power had to be vested in a central authority, at the
    expense of democracy.&quot; (Bretton, 1980)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1">&quot;We shall miss the essence
    of the money difficulty, if we fail to recognize the gulf which
    separates a weighted quantity of some valued material used for
    purposes of exchange, from a coinage which, though it be made
    of that material, becomes also numbers, symbols carrying the
    insignia of authority, tokens of something else, Coins changed
    the nature of wealth, which, more clearly separable now from
    divine right, was to be as powerful as ever. More than any other

    Furthermore, the resulting concept of national or collective
    prosperity was placed apart from, and above, the concept of individual
    prosperity. To the thorough-going Mercantilist, a condition of
    poverty among the majority of the population was in no way necessarily
    inconsistent with the prosperity of the state itself, and indeed
    might often be the essential condition of the latter. &quot;(Angell,

    that you cannot maximize something unless you have an index to

    is not-- the manufacturer who provided maximum satisfaction to
    many customers at minimum cost to society would grow rich in
    these symbols. ... it is clear that money has some drawbacks
    as an error- signal. For one thing, it does not show the direction
    and amount of error, so that when profits fall off, a period
    of hunting is necessary before a production system can locate
    the target again.... Money is also a poor error- signal for productivity
    because of its other index functions which, in many societies

    introduced into trade by the presence of money are fairly evident.
    The values of the articles exchanged cease to be expressed in
    terms of one another, and become expressed in terms of the common
    measure, money. The consequence is a much wider and quicker tendency
    to price equalization, since it is now possible to compare prices
    in different places with a fair assurance that the standard of
    measurement is the same. But two other consequences follow, and
    are due to the fact that the value of the common measurement
    is itself variable. Within any one country, the absolute level
    of this value is of course of no significance. But the differences
    in the effects produced by changes in the value of money upon
    different classes of commodities and services are important.
    These differences are ones of rapidity in response... and also,
    frequently, of degree, for permanent changes in relative values
    may follow.... As between countries, however .... A change in
    the general level of prices in one country, unaccompanied by
    an equivalent movement of the exchange rates, will have precisely
    the same effect upon a foreign country as though demand and cost
    schedules had themselves changed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="-1">&quot;(When foreign exchange
    mechanisms are introduced) Articles in one country are no longer
    exchanged for those produced in another country. They are exchanged
    for the currency of the country of origin; this is exchanged
    for claims to the currency of the other country; and these claims,
    in turn, are directly or indirectly exchanged for goods there.
    ... Under barter, each transaction is entirely devoid of direct
    mechanical connection with any other transaction, unless it be
    those in the particular article concerned. But where a foreign
    exchange mechanism exists, each transaction is intimately related
    with all the others taking place at the same time.... Each is
    primarily dominated by the aggregate of the others, but it also
    contributes its small share towards determining the aggregate
    itself. &quot; (Angell, 1926)</FONT></P>

    in, holders of the one currency would abandon their holdings
    when depreciation is suspected, thus lowering its value whether
    depreciation would have otherwise occurred or not. Any prolonged
    deficit of trade would run the risk of exhausting the bullion
    reserve leading to uncomforting conditions in world trade and
    finance. These concerns led Britain to abandon the gold standard
    in 1931, and to attempt to stabilize its currency through official
    transaction-- the buying and selling of foreign currencies and
    gold in a way which countered the movements of excessive speculation.&quot;

    commitments often limit the capital which they can acquire, what
    they can spend, and how they can invest. Thus in closed communities--
    and often in open ones as well-- egalitarian styles of life are
    insisted on. Acquiring more wealth than one's fellows suggests
    that one has somehow robbed them and snatched more than one's
    fair share. Conspicuous consumption arouses envy, as it does
    in modern communities, but rather than awakening increased competition
    in order to surpass the Joneses, it calls up negative sanctions--
    distrust, gossip, ostracism, and witchcraft. There are characteristic
    institutions whereby such &#147;excess wealth&quot; is siphoned
    off so as to enhance rather than weaken social cohesion.&quot;

    a proof of usefulness. Rather than being a supplement to subsistent
    existence, wages came to be viewed-- by those who paid them--
    as the natural source of livelihood for a population. These populations
    had been excluded from the means of subsistence by progressive

    It should not be so difficult, however, to regard the event as

    the governed entered into a compact of sorts. In this case the
    understanding was that the wealth was to be employed in the interest
    of the greatest number. There is much room for doubt whether
    the compact was honored by the Revolutionary regime. There is
    no room for doubt, though, that the ingenious device invented
    by the regime to help finance the Revolution and guarantee its

    was in its final analysis an instrument of fraud. ... At one
    point, the purpose was to enable government to borrow money on
    the strength of landholdings to finance essential services. But,

    money for government and speculators, profit for both, and ruin
    for the economy as a whole.&quot; (Bretton, 1980)</FONT></P>
