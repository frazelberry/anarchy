  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Monetary symbolism -
  i.e., money - is born of the same intellect that produced language
  and mathematics. It is most closely related to atomistic materialism
  - that era of physics that attempted to reduce all phenomena
  to a common set of building blocks, the atom. While the atom
  has been blown apart and dismissed as anything concrete and substantial
  in itself, we have largely accustomed ourselves to its social
  allegory of <B>pricing</B>.</FONT></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In this mulifarious
  world of ours, populated already by nearly 5 billion people and
  rising, we rely on pricing to move goods and services to where
  they are needed and utilized. It's really marvelous, if you stand
  back and think about it. And it is based on widely touted theories
  of supply and demand. You probably already know this, so I'll
  put it simply. If there are two apples and three people want
  them, they'll bid up the price until one of the three loses interest.
  That is, until the price exceeds value. This <B><I>value</I></B>
  depends on factors like personal preference for fruits as well
  as how much money each person has to spend, that is to say, on
  income distribution.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Behind the touted
  theory, there lurk deeper assumptions about price and value.
  We say each will pay according to what something is worth and
  that implies value. But it is still a very relative value. I
  do not know much about wine, for example, but on such rare occassions
  as I am invited out, I might take an offering of wine with me.
  In selecting a wine, I make an assumption of worth based upon
  price - that a higher priced wine is better than a lower priced
  wine and will pay an extra buck for it. But the higher price
  may merely reflect that it comes from a region that experienced
  a drought in a given year, producing fewer and lower qualitiy
  grapes, resulting in a scarce supply, but which is not at all
  good.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">On the other
  hand, we may have things which come to us in abundance - like
  water, oxygen and sunshine - and we wouldn't pay a nickle for
  them, yet our every breath depends upon them. We think that because
  we haven't paid a nickle for air in the past, it must not be
  worth anything - or at least, not worth protecting. Pricing is
  a kind of information, you see, about our shared values. We take
  price to indicate what something is worth. This is like a magic
  show where the magician fools himself. If we haven't paid a nickle,
  it must not be worth a nickle. Ok, let's try it out. Everybody,
  hold your breath....</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Pricing, if it
  is to mean anything, must be based on something meaningful. If
  all of us, within our own individual budgets, determine the price
  of things, we need to take responsibility for that. Looking at
  my own tiny budget, I am really a wimp in the marketplace. And
  yet I do my part. Doing one's part is a different motivation
  than being strictly concerned with competitive advantage, with
  one's own self-inerest. Maybe miniscule in its immediate effect;
  yet it is profoundly, fundamentally, meaningful. </FONT></CENTER></P>
