    <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Whatever
    we think</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
    becomes what we experience. It is just t a matter of time. We are
    continuously caught in the push and pull of sensory experience. Do you not
    notice this is true? You have to pay attention once in awhile -&nbsp; it is
    you. What are your likes and dislikes.?... No one has the same; no matter
    what we may be told....</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">And if you grew up, as I nearly did, you studied historical
    accounts describing humanity as a bunch of murderer- rapist-
    thieves banding together waving flags, wearing this or that funny
    outfit, slaughtering someone on the </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">other side</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff91"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> If you stay at home a lot
    and watch the local news, and believe everything your are taught ih school
    -&nbsp; you become a prisoner of your own guards: putting up security systems and iron bars
    on the windows and purchase a gun with which you or your husband
    or children can injure each other and cause severe rifts in your
    household.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But is
    this really the case? Or is it more like when we go to the cinema
    to watch some action packed film with lots of explosives and
    brash sex and people with their heads hacked off. How often do
    you see stuff like this when you're out shoppping, for example? Rarely, I
    suggest. And if you do, youshould&nbsp; seriously consider moving to a
    different neighborhood. Seiously,&nbsp; we are all&nbsp; pretty much the
    same human being.&nbsp; We go to such cinemas precisely because these things are
    <I>not</I> experienced daily in our city streets. Just as we
    watch the news to learn about things we wouldn't know otherwise.
    And so it is with history. If it were reported to young school
    children that most of the time, their ancestors were really more
    preoccupied with growing food, providing shelter, paying bills,
    etc., these poor school children would never pay attention to
    anything we taught them.&nbsp; Despite whatever&nbsp; grading curve and
    punishments we may offer. School children would rather pretend that there
    were superheroes and supervillians, despite the fact that they have to deal
    -&nbsp; chiefly and daily&nbsp; - with one another.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This
    is not to say that the world has been a bed of roses, either.
    Each of us have a lot of bad habits. People have a habit of creating
    confict with each other. Good news: This is not&nbsp; genetic. This is not
    something we can not now or forever outgrow. We tend to view things like ths&nbsp;
    because we tend to view ourselves
    as individuals engaged in some kind of conquest against other
    individuals who are engaged in the same conquest against us. What bullshit.
    We need each other. We rely on each other daily. Not merely the ones we meet
    in our day to day interaction, but everything we pick up -- every tool we
    use; every material -- we very deeply and entirely rely upon others, living
    or dead. None of us - no matter what our strengths and efforts can make it
    on our own. And ever much so, our pleasures and satisfactions as human
    beings. Check it out - that's all I ask - how happy you would be if it is
    was up to you alone. IF, under your total and global control, would&nbsp;
    you - in fact- be&nbsp; happy? Our bank is an accumulation of works over many
    generations and cultures, not oneself alone. Our technological arts include language by which we speak to one another, as well as
    gestures, altars and arts. We do not merely exchange money, we
    exchange <I>values</I>; What is the basis of these values? Our value is
    based largely on the basis of self. Think about this - what is more valuable
    TO YOU than yourself? And yet, as a basis of value - is this in itself
    REALLY valuable? Check it out .&nbsp; Would&nbsp; you be happy on&nbsp; your
    own?</FONT></P>

    <P><font color="#ffff91" size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">We don't know. There
    is not such an example. It is only as a result of much misinformation about ourselves
    that we have devised
    a great scheme of interactions and have incorporated them into
    our daily lives: the masks we portray to each other in conversations,
    the manner in which we drive our cars, the rhetoric of our politicians,
    and so on. We pay homage to the fiction of the competitive will
    in each of us, ambitions and an individual </font><B><FONT COLOR="#00ffff"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">person</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">or <I>soul</I> who manifests great achievement
    in strife with everything else.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">I propose
    that the reality that makes all this possible, that provides
    each of us with a continuation of our lives and standards of
    living, and maintains our humanity in all of its splendor, is
    not these individuals out there slugging their way through a
    marketplace. Rather, it is our commonality and cooperation.</FONT><FONT
     COLOR="#ffff91" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff91"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This is my <B>thesis. </B>And
    to support such a way of looking at things, I will present my
    own historical accounts, pyschology and personal reflection.</FONT></P>
