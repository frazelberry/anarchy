  <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The history of human civilization
  is rich in magic</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">,
  and the future of civilization will depend on it as well. Taboos
  and totems, priests and shamins, tokens and talismans are present
  in all cultures including our own, despite the generally accepted
  belief that our own time - of science and industry - has risen
  to a new level of truth.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Max Weber - a powerful
  figure in social academics - equates the rise of capitalism to
  the fall of magic.</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> In the last resort the
    factor which produced capitalism is the rational permanent enterprise,
    rational accounting, rational technology and rational law, but
    again not these alone. Necessary complementary factors were the
    rational spirit, the rationalization of the conduct of life in
    general, and a rationalistic economic ethic. (Weber, 1927, p354)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">He uses the word 'rational'
  7 times in 2 sentences, a brave gesture in any language. Weber,
  unfortunately, died before the advent of television. Had he lived
  to study it, he would have found a new spell upon the land. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">People  are continuously
  and willingly duped by media magicians on television, radio,
  in front of magazine racks and behind newspapers. Then, trancelike,
  we walk about through our lives and among other people, learning
  our parts by rote and repetition by what we say, based largely
  upon what we ourselves have heard. Concepts and opinions, rumors
  and allegations, slogans and bi-polar party positions are assumed
  as one's own identity and embraced like personal name or homeland.
  </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We are duped into thinking
  our neighbors are our enemies; that politicians are our friends;
  that the politics of the rich and powerful is the party of the
  working class; we are pitted against each other and the poor
  wage earners in other countries willing to work for less, while
  courting their employer -  the multi-national corporation that
  pollutes the planet, exploits the consumer and sets the agendas
  of its puppet nation-states. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Rational idealism is
  at its basis magic. It is a mental phenomena. Its hocus pocus
  is &quot;divide and conquer&quot;. If we can be made to work
  against one another - if we regard other nationals or class or
  single mothers as alien to us - we will give our power to the
  those warlords who will protect us from the warlord on the other
  side. We will be taxed - or pledged to be taxed - to produce
  redundant methods of global annihilation and gross profits. And
  we feel great pride in this. What nonsense!</FONT></P>
