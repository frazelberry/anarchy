<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Over half of school age children
admit to having been bullied at one time or another. </FONT><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The Jonesboro masacre has been
attributed to a bully with a rifle. We are astonished to find
violence in our public schools of this degree, but I remember
my own school to be very violent as well. As I suppose<IMG SRC="jonesboro.jpg"

most are. But it is usually violence in more socially accepted
forms of bullying - intimidation, taunting, sarcasm and ridicule.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Researchers have finally
given up their notion of &quot;the poor bully&quot;, having assumed
from the beginning that bullies must be exhibiting their own poor
self-esteem. This is hiding the obvious. Bullies enrich their
esteem - their pride in themselves - by depriving the same from
their cohorts. An effort in Norway to deal with the issue revealed
that 80% of students who were targets of bullies exhibited &quot;insecurity,
feelings of being worthless and that they would probably not fight
back.&quot;<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;mature&quot;
response offered by cohorts and instructors was to fight back,
&quot;Don't let him pick on you.&quot; And so the blame is placed
on the victim.  But bullying is really a form of <B>collective
power</B>. The bully abuses his victim publicly, before his peers,
and enjoys a show of strength, while the victim draws additional
scorn and ridicule. It is a social theatre, not a personal one.
Any treatment that aims at the individual, therefore, will miss
it entirely. It is from the social group that the individual draws
feelings of insecurity and worthlessness. This, in turn, draws
additional abuse. And so it goes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> Some children enjoy fighting.
It is a normative value. Violence and intimidation are the means
to exhibit and solidify power in a social setting. Bullying is
not always directed at stronger to weaker - girls can bully as
much as boys - but is more a question of perceived social values.
 Bullies perceive violence as more respectable than do their victims,
who may value other social or moral norms. But within the context
of the social setting, the bully is usually right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> The big tough guy model
is, of course, all over the place. It is in most movies, most
video arcades, most prisons. Ghandi, Mandella, the Dalai Lama,
and others who exemplify nonviolence and compassion are unknown
to most children. If they were, the victims of bully-abuse would
not have to feel such loss of esteem, worthless or defeated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Bullies control this world
because we give them respect. Victims are such because they lose
their own. It is just this simple. We do not have to respect bullies;
we do not have to blame victims. They are behaviors - a social
relation. We should respect those who respect others; elicit encouragement,
not criticism; provide help, and not harm. Why don't we teach
this in our schools?</FONT></P>
