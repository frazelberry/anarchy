<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Each of us knows the feelings of
sadness and joy.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> We
have all experienced pain. We have desired and grown attached
to certain things; and we have hated or feared others. We have
known haughtiness and pride; and very likely we have suffered
humiliating defeat. These are the shades and textures of consciousness
which indicate that consciousness is shared, not isolated and
alone. Violence is endemic to society: child abduction, sexual
murders, school shootings, armed dialogue between husband and
wife. So also are charity, brotherhood, loyalty and friendship.
These things do not occur isolated in time and location - they
manifest among us, as humanity, where ever we exist. It is difficult
to put blame on a murderous villain, when hatred lurks just beneath
one's own indignation, betraying one's complicity to humanity's
faults.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This is consciousness
- our consciousness - hate and love are not owned by anyone. You
cannot put a fence around it and charge admission to love. Prostitution
and divorce courts are not about love. Love cannot be arbitrated
nor can it become a &quot;utility&quot; of the market. Nor is
it a strictly human trait. Haughtiness and pride are maybe strictly
human. In our haughtiness we may write poetically and sing about
our wondrous love for another, but we reduce the affection of
another specie to instinct. Love and loyalty are clearly visible
among many species; as is fear. Fear is clearly visible as response
to one of us. It is from haughtiness and arrogance that we casually
take the life of another being, human or otherwise. And yet, when
you observe closely - when you think about it - these other beings
have exactly the same consciousness you do. They know pain. They
know fear. And they know love. Love is not owned by anyone; it
exists solely to be shared.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">You cannot gain power
as a person until you recognize this. Until that time, you are
merely wreckless, engaging in whatever momentary impulse directs
your presumed inner soul to commit whatever good or horrendous
thing. Taking power as a person means being inner directed from
a source or center with honesty and integrity. Until such time,
one is duped. You may think that you have performed such and such,
and that you acted intelligently. Odds are, you did what you thought
others expected of you in a determined fashion; or you were driven
by a vague impulse to prove some equally vague thing, creating
mayhem and disaster in the process. Your love may be attachment;
your contempt, envy. Until you know what you are working with,
you will not know how to work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Power as a person begins
within mind - the consolidation of mind: attention and intention.
One cannot master any subject or engage meaningfully in anything
without the use of these. Attention contains both concentration
and diligence. Diligence is necessary to call the mind back when
consciousness slips away again and again after any number of distractions.
Intention contains motivation and courage. Courage is a little
stronger than confidence which is also surely needed. But being
a free person will often mean standing apart from the crowd: going
against the stream. Most people, I think, lack such courage. They
have confidence, surely. They can stand up within a crowd and
take control or assume an intimidating or strong position. But
this is not the same as what we mean here by freedom. Freedom
does not need to control others. Freedom does not ask permission.
Freedom is the power of one's mind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Motivation is the direction
of that power. Without motivation, activity is reflex; speech
is meaningless chatter; thought is discursive. To speak of a person
as an individual at all requires that this vast complex of impulses,
processes and ideas we normally call 'self' has some unifying
principle or directive. Survival is a natural impulse of life,
but not sufficient to self. Self requires a meaning greater than
perpetuation of self, greater than life. Status and wealth are
not sufficient to self; these things come and go and cannot sustain
a unity for self. 'Self' strives to know God, if not to be one
with God. This is the power of freedom, the power of mind: to
strive to know and be God. This inner directive is as close as
we can get to an actual self, and yet - at the same time - to
approach there, to pursue that intention, is to transcend that
self.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Freedom of self is very
much freedom from self. To stand apart from the crowd means having
no concern for what others think about you. Courage very much
means having no concern for success or failure for 'self.' Diligence
to attain one's goal requires infinite patience in the face of
countless obstacles, which present themselves again and again
long after you thought you were through. If you depend upon reputation,
on what others think, attachment to success or fear of failure,
you are attached to self and not at all free. Freedom of self
must have an intention greater than self. It must strive to be
more than it is, or what is thought to be. It must push the envelope
and thereby win its freedom: freedom from itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">And so, behold the person:
a free and powerful being.  An inner directed being, motivated
not for something as small and restrictive as its self, but an
expression of the creative power in all of us unleashed. And what
would such a being be motivated to do? What might he or she accomplish?
Would he or she be successful in business, in love or in the community?
Perhaps. But perhaps not in the usual meaning of success. His
employees might be happy and productive; her husband fulfilled;
their community might be friendly and charitable. These are more
likely the successful outcome of such a person's motivation -
an intention that transcended 'self.'</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">It is argued then that
what we normally call success is just selfish. What we call power
is dependence. What we call freedom is a prison. We are caught
in the snares of these images before others, trying to get the
best of the other guy in his trap. And not seeing, by so doing,
we merely manipulate ourselves. How long will the rat in his Skinner
box want another pellet? Wouldn't he prefer to be free?</FONT><!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--></P>
