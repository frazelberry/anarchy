  <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">1. The Meaning of
  Power</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The discussion of change
  in the preceding chapter was a morphology and not an aetiology
  of change, to use the terms applied by Schopenhauer in another
  context. The discussion set forth the nature of change but did
  not consider the cause of change. The major thesis of this book
  is that the cause of change is power. Change and power have a
  reciprocal relationship. The being of change depends on the being
  of power, as this chapter will attempt to show in some detail.
  And the meaning of power depends on that of change. In a domain
  entirely alien to change there would be no reason to inquire
  into power. Eternal and timeless universals and relations of
  universals would have no beginning and no operation to require
  power, and they would face no threat of destruction to be met
  with power. The same would be true of infinite mind similarly
  described, if it is timeless and not everlasting; and if it had
  power, but remained changeless by hypothesis, it would have no
  service from the power, whether to feel and think, or to create
  and govern the world. It will appear presently that power divorced
  from change is almost a contradiction in terms, since power tends
  inherently toward change and is restrained only by contrary power
  with the same inherent tendency; for infinite mind coupled with
  infinite power, the divorce would be self-contradictory, since
  there could be no contrary power. (83)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">To develop the thesis
  that power is the cause of change, change will be considered
  under the type of positional change in space, or motion. Formal
  change is more complex than motion: it presupposes motion and
  adds to the apparatus of power and motion further requirements
  which will be considered in the chapter on creativity. (83)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Before power is analyzed
  in detail, some distinctions of level can be made, which may
  prevent unnecessary ambiguity. &quot;Power as such&quot; will
  refer to the basic and universal nature of power, a being particular
  and concrete located equally and indifferently in each of the
  succeeding levels. It is formless, though in many of its locations
  it is associated with form. Primordial power is one, presumably
  infinite, interpenetrating in a primitive space, and formless.
  It is the logically first level of power, due to its simplicity.
  It is the analogue of matter uniformly dispersed, as in a nebula
  of sufficient simplicity and rarity. Whether power in the primordial
  mode has being, or is merely a logical and ideal limit, is not
  a matter on which this chapter makes any judgment. Finite power
  is many and spatially distinct; it occurs prior to form and in
  association with form, as in bodies and in feelings; when referred
  to simply as &quot;finite power,&quot; it is considered as prior
  to form or in abstraction from any form it may have. When power
  or powers are referred to in this chapter, without further qualification,
  the referent will be a finite power or finite powers, prior to
  form. Physical power is power differentiated according to the
  forms appropriate to the several kinds of physical energy or
  force, such as electricity, magnetism, gravitation, and heat.
  Bodies are physical powers formed spatially with shape, size,
  and fixed or rigid boundaries; they are particles or unions of
  particles. Feelings are powers formed under the generic form
  of consciousness; they reveal within themselves finite power
  but not bodies or physical powers; they are regarded in this
  book as dependent upon the latter proximately and upon finite
  powers ultimately. Power formed physically, materially, and mentally
  will be considered in later chapters. (84)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In this section the analysis
  of power will be made with two initial terms, finite power and
  change. Although based on materials from ordinary experience,
  the analysis will be dialectical in procedure, assembling concepts
  for a coherent and sufficient account of the meanin<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->g
  of &quot;power.&quot; The problem of the reality of power will
  be taken up in a later section. (84)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The meaning of power
  begins with the conception of power as cause in relation to change.
  Following Bergson, the two major conceptions of causality can
  be labeled dynamical and statical. (84)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The dynamical conception
  asserts that the cause has an efficacy by which it produces the
  effect; since the productive efficacy is sufficient to constitute
  a causal relationship, the theory does not depend on uniformity
  in the relationship, and may assert it or not do so. The statical
  conception denies productive efficacy and asserts uniformity
  or law in the relationship as the meaning of causality. It is
  clear that power as cause falls under the dynamical label: power
  has productive efficacy and it alone supplies meaning to that
  phrase. In the usual application of the dynamical theory, causes
  and effects are bodies or feelings, which consist of forms conjoined
  with obscure instances of power; the forms are epiphenomena of
  the powers and signs of each other; and the transition from one
  form to another is effected by the underlying powers. At the
  present highly general level of discussion, formed beings and
  multiple powers are not yet in view. What are involved are a
  given finite power, a given positional change without form or
  in abstraction from form, and a causal relation between them.
  The power is the productive cause of the positional change, or
  motion. The relation also conforms, to some extent at least,
  to the uniformity of connection asserted by the statical theory.
  Finite power is uniformly connected with change, as the ensuing
  analysis will show, except when prevented by contrary power.
  Lacking such contrariety, primordial power is always engaged
  in change. Whether a given finite power is always followed by
  a given motion will be discussed later, as will the question
  of necessity in the causal relationship . (85)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Causes may be classed
  as transitive causes and originative causes. A transitive cause
  requires for its causal function that it be the effect of a preceding
  cause, which may have the same requirement in indefinite regress.
  An originative cause is the source of its causal function and
  does not require a preceding cause for that role, though it may
  still require another cause for its being. Statical causes generally
  are transitive causes, since nothing distinctive is claimed for
  the cause in relation to the effect and the emphasis is on the
  de facto uniformity of relation; an exception occurs if the statical
  theory is accompanied by a claim that the effect can be deduced
  by reason from the cause. A dynamical cause properly understood
  in regard to power is an originative cause of motion. The sufficient
  cause of the motion in question is the finite power, which contains
  in itself, as power, all that is needed to produce the motion.
  This thesis of originative causation will not be extended to
  forms produced by powers, as a later discussion will show. As
  originative cause of motion, power will be called the source
  of motion. (85, 86)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The deficiency of the
  factor of cause or source in the relation of power to motion
  is that causes and effects ordinarily are thought to have some
  degree of separateness from each other. The separateness occurs
  in space in the partial or complete impenetrability of bodies
  and in action at significant distance. It occurs in time in the
  frequent assumption of temporal succession between cause and
  effect, which involves a gap in time no matter how small it may
  be. It occurs in nature by the identification of causes and effects
  by their respective associated forms, which are determinate and
  thus mutually bounded. Power as cause is related to change more
  intimately than the bare notion of source indicates. The first
  token of this intimacy is the factor of ground: power is the
  ground of the effect, or motion. Like soil in relation to a plant,
  power underlies the motion and remains with it in continuing
  support. But a ground transcends its effect, and power does not
  have that degree of separateness from the motion. To the notion
  of ground must be added that of immanence, so that the power
  penetrates the effect without losing its distinctive nature.
  Power does not transcend change but is immanent in it. It produces
  change not by a rupture of essential detachment, but by an inherent
  commitment to change. Where it does not produce change, that
  is because it has been blocked by contrary power, or has assumed
  organizing and disciplining forms: these alternatives concern
  later stages of the theory of power. This is to say that motion
  is power moving: motion is a contingent attribute of power, in
  which power inheres when the motion occurs. But immanence does
  not take us to the heart of the source of change. Penetration
  of change does not take us within power, and inherent commitment
  does not describe the nature of what inheres within power. Power
  as source thus needs a term beyond ground and immanence and peculiar
  to power: the term is tendency within power to produce change.
  (86)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Tendency may be pursued
  in several stages. Tendency in power contains the factor of genesis
  or beginning, which can be described loosely as a transition
  from power to motion. The description is loose, for transition
  in its literal sense is a kind of change, and that is not intended
  here. By virtue of genesis, the mobility of motion, as distinct
  from the extents occupied by motion, grows without breaks from
  power. Genesis is meant to secure continuity between power and
  motion, of a kind more supple and complete than a continuity
  based on repetition of original terms by intermediates of like
  kind. The continuity in genesis should not be confused with the
  continuity in mobility, for genesis is part of tendency toward
  change, which is distinct from change. But the second continuity
  stems from the first, for mobility is power mobile, and any interval
  of power moving is the effect of power tending toward that motion
  and may contain tendency toward further motion: the suppleness
  of power tending is the source of the suppleness of mobility.
  (86, 87)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Genesis presupposes a
  directional or vector factor in tendency, which is based in power
  and ends in change. The vector is very slight. It implies no
  goal for power in change: a goal belongs to valuation and mind,
  which are later formations of power. It implies no accumulation
  or consistency of directions: these require forms capable of
  an hierarchical pattern: but forms, and still more patterns of
  forms in evolutionary order, are beyond the scope of bare motion.
  The essence of the vector is direction beyond the place at which
  the tendency began. It may be illustrated by the radiation of
  physical energy outward from a center. Terms drawn from space
  are appropriate in describing tendency toward motion, for motion
  is in space. But transit in a simple feeling does not involve
  space, but it contains a vector factor. For greater generality,
  the directional factor can be spoken of as a transcending toward
  another. (87)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Direction in turn implies
  a factor of anticipation in tendency. This aspect of tendency
  does not consist in an idea, however obscure and tentative, of
  change or direction toward change: symbolic function is a form
  that belongs to the class of forms called mental and is not available
  to power as such. The nature of anticipation may be sought in
  the relation of potential to actual. Power may be thought to
  contain in a potential condition what change subsequently is
  in actuality. Potentiality embraces two very diverse motifs.
  One is the advance edition of the actual being, which was mentioned
  in the account of change in the preceding chapter. The other
  is a principle of growth from the potential to the actual conditions.
  The second element is congenial to the philosophy of power, but
  it tells us nothing about tendency in power: growth is a kind
  of change and the principle of growth is power accompanied by
  the forms that define life. The first motif also fails to shed
  light on tendency. The advance edition consists of forms which
  resemble, in a diminished way, those which define the actual
  condition; but forms are not available for tendency toward bare
  motion. Forms may be disposed of, but the potential condition
  must still resemble in some degree the actual condition in order
  to be called the potential for the actual. Resemblance could
  only be claimed between the tendency toward motion and the motion:
  that is, by converting tendency, at least in part, into motion.
  The conversion leads to repetition of motion in the term designed
  to explain it: the repetition does not explain, but begs the
  question. The conversion also leads to diminution or elimination
  of tendency and so of power: to the extent that the conversion
  is admitted, the power is denied which alone can generate motion.
  Contrary to a tradition which identifies power with a potentiality
  or capacity for acting (or for suffering, which is correlative
  with a capacity for acting elsewhere), the aspect of potentiality
  must be deferred to a later stage in the history of power, in
  which forms indicate the containment of power in a society of
  powers. It is possible for tendency toward motion to be contained
  so that it does not lead to motion, but it is not possible for
  tendency to generate motion if it is merely a potential for,
  and advance edition of, motion. Anticipation must be simpler
  than idea or potentiality. Its nature is elusive when comparisons
  are sought with other terms: but the experience of power seems
  to include an experience of anticipation as the culmination of
  tendency prior to change. (87, 88)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The terms used to describe
  tendency do not complete the analysis of power. They presuppose
  something which tends. This something has its first manifestation
  in tendency, but it is not exhausted in that condition. It is
  the inner nature of power. Various terms may be proposed for
  the elucidation of that nature. Impulse and thrust, which differ
  from each other as subtle and gross, have relevance here; they
  are inadequate because they dilute the meaning of what tends
  in the direction of tendency. Force and energy, taken loosely,
  are synonyms for power and in that capacity embrace the aspects
  of cause, immanence, and tendency as well as the something that
  tends. Taken precisely, they specify power as physical and are
  too narrow for the present purpose, which is to account for power
  as such. In physics they have syntactical meaning from their
  place in equations and allied theory; but the inquiry into their
  referential meaning is problematic, and needs more help from
  the theory of power than it can give the theory. (88, 89)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A more promising candidate
  for the something that tends is effort, which is often mentioned
  by proponents and opponents of the theory of power. Effort may
  occur in the lifting of a weight. Muscular contraction occurs
  and with it kinaesthetic sensation of the muscular activity.
  If the weight is light, lifting takes place without any experience
  of effort in the kinaesthetic report. If the weight is heavy,
  resistance is reported and, in reply to it, effort is experienced
  as a compensatory factor. The effort may be successful or not
  in lifting the weight. In either case it is experienced as tending
  toward the willed outcome, whose stages are the adequate contraction
  of the muscle, the movement of the arm, and the desired change
  in the position of the weight. The distinction between effort
  and tendency is evident in the observation that tendency is equally
  present in unsuccessful and successful effort against the same
  resistance, while the magnitude of that which tends, or effort,
  increases for successful effort. Effort thus is more than tendency.
  But it falls short of being power as such. Effort is conjoined
  with resistance and can be certified of power only in that conjunction.
  The resistance is furnished by contrary power. Power as such
  exists in individual powers apart from the contingency of social
  relations, of opposition and cooperation. In addition, effort
  is a response to resistance in the volitional sphere, which implies
  the forms of mind. Its transfer to physical power, which involves
  the forms of matter or of energy as physical, and to power as
  such, which involves no forms, is dubious: it appears to involve
  what has been called a &quot;category mistake.&quot; (89)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">What is left for the
  something that tends when effort is put aside is an essence which,
  for want of a better name, may be called intensity. This term
  may be applied equally to an emotion, a sensum, a muscular effort,
  or an electromagnetic field. It inherits no parochial characters
  from these areas; on the contrary, intensity in these places
  is a borrowing from power as such, which is pure intensity. Intensity
  appears to stand at the center of what tends, and to have at
  once a nature of its own and tendency from that nature toward
  change. It appears to be the substance of what tends, rather
  than the most proximate description of it. (89, 90)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The intensity at hand
  is radically indeterminate. It is the source of positional change
  but is not itself change, though it is tendency toward change.
  Through positional change it is the source of formal change but
  is not itself any form. The source of form can be a source only
  if it lacks the form in question, and the form can have a source
  only in something that is prior in nature to the form. A version
  of the logic of the indeterminateness of the foundation of the
  determinate was stated by Plato in the <I>Timaeus </I>in a passage
  concerning the receptacle, or space, which is distinguished alike
  from eternal forms and changing particulars: (90)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For if the matter were
  like any of the supervening forms, then whenever any opposite
  or entirely different nature was stamped upon its surface, it
  would take the impression badly, because it would intrude its
  own shape.... In the same way that which is to receive perpetually
  and through its whole extent the resemblances of all eternal
  beings ought to be devoid of any particular form. (90)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The Platonic receptacle
  is the recipient and &quot;nurse&quot; of particular forms but
  is not the source of them. The requirement of indeterminateness
  is all the greater when the source of changes and forms is at
  hand: this thesis will be expanded later, in the discussion of
  creativity. (90)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Because of its radical
  indeterminateness, power is not readily identified in its essence.
  Change is relatively indeterminate, and its own nature as distinct
  from that of its terms has been shown to be elusive. Power is
  radically indeterminate, since it is prior in simplicity to both
  the terms and the relation in change. Probably the most obvious
  instance of power is effort as apprehended by kinaesthesis. But
  muscular sensation does not have the dramatic richness and clarity
  of vision or hearing. A red color lies on the surface of the
  public world; its hue contrasts sharply with other hues; it can
  be intuited in well-defined spatial relations to other colors,
  and perceived as part or sign of useful or interesting things.
  Kinaesthesis has little quality to allow contrasts for ready
  discernment; it reports positions, directions, and magnitudes
  of changes of muscles and limbs, and the subtle mobility that
  spans the extent between positions; its report on power is mingled
  with the other reports, like gray on gray. Its basic indeterminateness,
  and not its alleged absence from experience, accounts for the
  rejection of the notion of power by not a few philosophers. (90,
  91)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">2. Power, Freedom,
  and Compulsion</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The analysis of power
  into cause, tendency, and intensity is a definition of power,
  or statement of its necessary and sufficient traits. Several
  related terms remain. The relation of power to law, necessity,
  and spontaneity will be considered in chapter 6, which will have
  the benefit of the theory of form and of creativity. Substance,
  endurance, and the causation of power will be taken up in the
  final section of this chapter, after the reality of power has
  been dealt with. Two terms can be discussed in principle at this
  point, and should not be postponed. These are freedom and compulsion.
  Since power often takes the form of compulsion and domination,
  and may suggest an ethics which sanctions these, it is important
  to assert that compulsion is not inherent in power, and that
  power can be a cornerstone of an ethics of universal sympathy.
  Such a role in ethics appears in Aquinas, Spinoza, and Tillich,
  but without an adequate analysis of power to support the role,
  and with the influence of Nietzsche, perverse as well as saintly,
  to confuse the matter. (91)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Power is free to the
  extent that its tendency is executed in change, and that it is
  the sole cause of the changes in which it participates. Power
  is compelled to the extent that its tendency is blocked so that
  change does not occur, and that other power causes the changes
  in which the power participates. There are reasons to believe
  that the provision regarding tendency is secondary. Insofar as
  powers can be distinguished from each other, there may be sufficient
  distance between them so that interference by other power will
  be after and not before the execution of tendency in change.
  Domination is not directed to immobility in a power, but to control
  of the changes or operations of a power. In practice, then, only
  the second half of the two definitions is needed: power is free
  to the extent that it is the sole cause of the changes in which
  it participates, and it is compelled to the extent that other
  power causes the changes. Secondarily and derivatively, change
  is free or compelled as the participating power is one or the
  other. Activity is the fused condition of power, change, and
  freedom: a condition of change as issuing from free power, or
  of power freely operating in its proper changes. Passivity is
  a similar condition of power, change, and compulsion. Bare change
  is neither active nor passive. Power is one or the other, but
  only as engaged in change. (91, 92)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Compulsion implies the
  overcoming of resistance to secure the effect that takes place.
  The scope of compulsion is more limited than it may appear to
  be. It has been seen that changes are compelled only derivatively,
  by extension from the powers at hand. More significantly, the
  compulsion of one power by another is not total. Different powers
  dominated by the same power operate differently, and the difference
  has its source not in the initial power but in those that are
  compelled, which retain some freedom amid the compulsion they
  suffer. Freedom can be destroyed only when the power is destroyed.
  But it will appear presently that power as such cannot be destroyed.
  Only a mode of formation of power can be destroyed, and with
  it the freedom of that mode. Thus every finite power is guaranteed
  a minimum of freedom. But freedom is of value only for minds,
  which are complex formations of power or presuppose them, and
  do not as minds share the guarantee of being. And they can be
  deformed, and debased, if their freedom is significantly reduced
  amid compulsion. (92)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Complete freedom can
  exist only in a being that has no limits and therefore is infinite.
  Primordial power, if it exists or has existed, is the original
  possessor of freedom, though the freedom is barren from want
  of form to give it diversity and unity. This freedom is lost
  to finite powers and to formations of power. If the power of
  others is not inflicted upon them, they still are blocked or
  inhibited by it, or depend on it for actions that exceed their
  own power. Here minds have an advantage over finite powers and
  bodies. Through sympathy and reason, which belong only to minds,
  powers can be united with regard to ends and means, so that confrontation,
  compulsion, and indifference can yield to shared encounter and
  cooperation. Since resistance is not necessary to the being of
  power, and the overcoming of resistance is not necessary to its
  operation, there is no categorial need for compulsion and servitude.
  But limits to shared encounter are set by the contingent forms
  of beings and situations. The hungry wolf will eat the lamb instead
  of lying down beside it, and the lamb will shrink from a peaceable
  wolf. Whether power is the primary being or not, there is no
  magic formula for the good, on whose behalf the formed powers
  that love the good must struggle with only modest assurances.

  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">3. The Reality of
  Power</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The elucidation of the
  meaning of power sets the stage for inquiry into the reality
  of the power sketched in that analysis. But the problem of the
  reality of power can be. reduced by a procedure which bypasses
  the analysis. Power can be defined as the cause of change, and
  its reality can be inferred from two premises: the reality of
  change and the necessity of a cause for it. The first premise
  is beyond dispute for this book. The claim of necessity for a
  cause is a rationalistic claim, which reason does not demonstrate.
  As stated in the opening chapter, rational necessity can be maintained
  only for analytic propositions. But the notions of cause and
  of change are distinct notions, which cannot be embraced in an
  analytic statement. The notion of cause is the analytic reciprocal
  of the notion of effect, but it would be begging the question
  to identify the concept of change with that of effect. The concept
  of cause appears to be part of the concept of experience in Kantian
  philosophy, with a correlated exclusion of bare feeling on the
  one hand and noumena on the other: a high price to pay,for the
  validation of causality, which occurs at the level of bare feeling
  or Bergsonian intuition and should not be excluded from the ultimately
  real. And if a necessary cause for change should be granted,
  the power defined as the cause of change would be entirely unknown
  in its own nature: &quot;power&quot; would be merely a label
  for whatever it might be that is the cause of change. Given such
  problems and so slight a result, the economical procedure in
  question will be rejected. (93, 94)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Assuming the meaning
  of power developed in this chapter, the problem of the reality
  of power may be pursued in four areas: the Psychical, the psychophysical,
  the physical, and the metaphysical. Power is experienced introspectively
  in the Psychical and psychophysical loci, and the experience
  yields a content or nature for power and a referential meaning
  for the word. The question arises as to whether the content experienced
  is a mere appearance or a reality, the illusion of power or the
  substance of power. Power is not experienced in the physical
  area. Under the partial synonym of force, it is inferred in mechanics
  as the source of motion and specifically of acceleration. The
  inferred term has syntactical meaning from its place in equations,
  but it has no referential meaning independent of power as found
  in other areas. Power is not experienced in the metaphysical
  locus either, except perhaps by a mystical experience which cannot
  define its nature or relate it to its similars in other areas.
  For metaphysics, power is inferred as the source of change in
  general, and it is given content by a dialectical process including
  abstraction and generalization from the content given to introspection.
  In the order of knowing, then, the problem of the reality of
  power begins with the Psychical and psychophysical contexts,
  where a content is experienced and the question of its reality
  can be handled with maximum directness. (94)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">If a short interval of
  consciousness is considered apart from the stream that precedes
  and follows it, from the self that may inhabit or underlie the
  stream, and from special qualities that may distinguish it in
  character from other intervals, the interval has certain characteristics
  that have significance for power. (94)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The interval appears
  to be in a process of coming to be, enduring briefly, ceasing,
  and further coming to be and ceasing. It renews itself continually,
  and the renewal is a series of novel feelings, apart from novelty
  in qualities that may be illustrated in the interval. This flux
  may be more readily acknowledged if the contribution of memory
  to the interval is dropped from consideration. Without memory,
  feeling occupies only the immediate present available to nonsymbolic
  awareness, without recollection of the past or anticipation of
  the future. Each present moment therefore is new, as is the feeling
  identified with the moment. The addition of memory does not annul
  the novelty, but tends to obscure it. This inherent flux in consciousness
  stands in contrast to the persistence and rigidity of the particle
  of classical materialism. But the flux is not simply chan e.
  A given moment of feeling betrays a tendency beyond itself which
  is fulfilled in the new moment. The tendency in turn is felt
  to belong to something that tends, which occurs within the scope
  of consciousness. The something is apparent power: here a slight
  intensity which tends toward the subtle changes of feeling. (94,
  95)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The most interesting
  of the qualities that may inhabit the interval of consciousness
  is pleasure. A feeling of pleasure shares with other instances
  of consciousness the relation to power sketched in the preceding
  paragraph. But the pleasure has a relation to value which introduces
  further relations to power. A feeling of pleasure displays a
  quality which belongs to all pleasures amid apparent differences
  of quality in pleasures. This quality is a process of immediate
  valuation, which is prior to discursive valuation in reflective
  thought and is positive. The process values proximately the object
  of pleasure, such as a poem or a friend, and ultimately its own
  quality, affirming both. Pleasure thus is a value as well as
  a valuation. (95)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Intrinsic value is the
  consciousness of the fulfilment of power in freedom, and pleasure
  is the quality in consciousness of the fulfilment. Pleasure therefore
  has a relation to power that other qualities of consciousness
  do not have: the flux of consciousness is in them, but pleasure
  in addition is felt as pervaded by power. This condition underlies
  the opinions of Aristotle, that pleasure enhances the activity
  that it accompanies; of Spinoza, that it is the emotion by which
  the mind passes to a greater perfection <I>;5</I> and of Nietzsche,
  that pleasure is a symptom of the feeling of increased power
  .(95)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In these two instances
  of feeling, power appears within the scope of consciousness and
  has an assignable content and place. But it may be held that
  it is a mere appearance which, when identified with reality,
  is an illusion. It was asserted in chapter 3, section 3, that
  an illusion is a being which is subjective or an effect and is
  taken as objective or a cause. Since the phenomenon of power
  is attributed to consciousness rather than to an external being,
  there is no problem here of erroneous attribution of a subjective
  essence to an objective essence, as there is for a dualist in
  the ascription of a red color to an apple. The proposal that
  the phenomenon of power is merely an effect and not a cause in
  the conscious interval is refuted by two data of the awareness
  in question: changes occur in the feeling in sequel to the operation
  of the power in the feeling, and the experience of the power
  is an experience of the efficacy of the power in bringing about
  the changes. This experience of efficacy, to which Whitehead
  attested so acutely, is complete in one particular instance,
  and does not require the dubious judgment of reason on a universal
  connection which goes beyond present and past particulars. Despite
  these refutations of the claim of illusion, it may be that the
  claim has in mind something more radical: that the phenomenon
  of power contradicts itself, or contradicts other realities duly
  accredited. Neither contradiction is evident. The meaning of
  power may be incomplete, as in the analysis of tendency, and
  some of its terms may have no similars elsewhere for conceptual
  fixation, but it has no irreconcilable members. To its credit,
  the theory of power does not attempt to explain or generate change
  by repeating change in advance: a procedure which appears to
  be self-contradictory. And the phenomenon of power does not contradict
  other realities in the feeling. For bare consciousness the reality
  other than power is change, and for pleasurable consciousness
  it is the quality of pleasure. Neither of these in its own essence,
  as an essence abstracted from the associated power, contradicts
  power. On the contrary, each is open to power in<B> </B>any account
  that may be made of its origin and cause. With the foregoing
  arguments in mind, it is evident that the appearance of power
  in the area of consciousness can be accepted as reality by reflective
  thought. (96)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Systematic theory will
  add a further test: coherence with a general system of theory.
  Since such a system is made of forms, and power is not a form,
  power can not be integrated with the system in any deductive
  sense. But there is a need in any theory of changing phenomena
  for an explanation of change, and the concept of power alone
  fills that place without merely repeating change in the explanation.
  In addition, a general theory of creativity can be formulated,
  according to which power creates form in encounter with other
  power. In these respects power coheres with systematic theory.
  However, the idea of power in feeling may conflict with a special
  theory regarding the epiphenomenal status of consciousness. This
  theory is stated not only by materialists, for whom consciousness
  is an epiphenomenon of material substance and does not influence
  the course of matter. It is stated also by Nietzsche, for whom
  consciousness is an epiphenomenon of volitional substance and
  does not influence the course of will. The present theory of
  power takes an intermediate position. As will be proposed in
  the next section, the only substance is power, and consciousness,
  like all form, is an epiphenomenon of power. It is not a source
  of change, whether in its own stream or elsewhere. But consciousness,
  like all form, has a bearing on the nature of change through
  its relation to power. This thesis will be developed in the chapter
  on mind. (96, 97)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The reality of power
  is also evident in the psychophysical stage, which comprises
  feeling in intimate relation with the &quot;interior&quot; of
  the human body. The interior is the body as known by organic
  sensation, kinaesthesis, and cutaneous sensation when one has
  in mind not the report of one's moving finger on one's skin,
  but the report of the skin moved on: a report one does not have
  when the same finger moves on the surface of a table. The exterior
  of the body is the same body, presumably, as known by the external
  senses, with emphasis on vision and touch, with the stipulation
  that the moving finger reports on the body as it would on the
  table. The exterior includes the body opened by the surgeon to
  the external senses. (97)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The interior of the body
  for organic sensation is a sea of ill-defined changes and tendencies
  toward change, as though it were an analogue of primordial power.
  More localized and available to inspection are muscular changes
  reported by kinaesthesis, as in the lifting of the weight discussed
  in the first section of this chapter. The contracting muscle
  may be felt to contain effort, as discussed above, where it was
  shown that a phenomenon of power acting against resistance occurs.
  Effort is not needed for that phenomenon, for a man walking smoothly
  and rhythmically for a short distance on level ground may experience,
  in his muscles and in his body more diffusely, tendency toward
  change. Effort or not, the power here may be of comparatively
  large magnitude on the scale of the body. Power in a muscle under
  dissection is not discerned by the external senses any more than
  it is discerned by them in a moving ball, but it is reported
  intimately by kinaesthesis. (97, 98)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">There is no reason to
  dismiss this phenomenon as illusory. For the reasons given under
  the Psychical area, there is no reason to speak of power in the
  muscle as contradictory or as merely an effect. The forms that
  define muscular tissues include those of nourishment, fatigue,
  and rest, which imply the acquisition and depletion of sources
  of energy: the energy is at least compatible with power, and
  will later be considered as a derivative of power as such.8 Relevant
  changes do occur after the experience of power, as though the
  power were their cause. But the question may be raised whether
  the reported power is actually in the muscle, or in the kinaesthetic
  sensation. It is incongruous to shift power from a highly probable
  location in the muscles to a highly improbable location in the
  feeling of the muscular change. The feeling does not claim such
  a location, and it lacks the muscular forms needed to sustain
  the alleged location for power. It may be concluded, then, that
  power attributed to the muscles is objective for that context
  rather than subjective. (98)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Systematic theory may
  raise a final question. In kinaesthesis, a physical change influences
  a Psychical change, in contradiction of the theory that body
  and mind are distinct substances, which cannot influence one
  another because of their radical disparateness in nature and
  the resulting conservation of their energies within their respective
  borders. This theory will be evaluated later.9 It may be noted
  here that the theory of power and form undercuts at least part
  of the theory: the premise that mind and matter are different
  substances. For this book, mind and matter are not substances,
  but are forms created by power, which is one substance present
  in all change. Apart from the theory of substance, the objection
  raised by the theory is too sweeping to be accepted by any philosophy
  that emphasizes the importance of sensory experience: for all
  sensation contains feeling caused in part by bodily stimulus.
  (98, 99)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">More problematic is the
  physical area, which consists of bodies, motions, and forces.
  The term force is used regularly in precise and meaningful statements
  of physics, the most basic of the empirical sciences; by a fine
  irony, it is sometimes thought to have no referential meaning
  and no reality. Newton's three laws of motion are concerned with
  bodies and forces. As though to emphasize the distinctive nature
  and reality of forces, the first law, of inertia, speaks of a
  body &quot;compelled to change&quot; its state of rest or uniform
  motion by &quot;forces impressed&quot; on the body. But Bertrand
  Russell characterized force as &quot;a mathematical fiction,
  not a physical entity,&quot; and recent commentators on Newton
  are uncertain of the status of force in the three laws. Since
  recent physics has moved to the thesis of the equivalence of
  mass and energy, it should favor a strict reading of Newton rather
  than a dilution of his statement. (99)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The problem is partly
  that physical force is not experienced with the directness claimed
  for power in the Psychical and psychophysical areas. Two colliding
  bodies other than<B> </B>the body of an observer have a dynamic
  interplay which is revealed only in changes of velocity and in
  displacement of parts, and is inferred from those changes. If
  one of the bodies is that of an observer, the impact of the other
  is perceived as force exerted by the other: the observer will
  say that the projectile &quot;hit him hard&quot; or with great
  force. It may be objected that the only force sensed by the observer
  is that of the resistance of his own body to the force of the
  other, and that the latter force is inferred. As sense perception
  regularly involves a quick inference from effects to causes,
  the inference can still be called a perception. Whether perceptual
  or not, the inference involves nothing more risky than a claim
  of something in the other body similar to the force felt in the
  body of the observer. (99)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The other part of the
  problem is that the latter force is attended by the affective
  form of pain and the volitional form of effort and strain, which
  are suitable for the psychophysical complex of the interior of
  the observer's body, but are alien to the purely physical nature
  of the projectile. No one will impute pain to the latter, but
  it is thought that the imputation of force involves, and must
  involve, effort and strain. That opinion leads to the rejection
  of the inference and the denial of force in matter. The opinion
  is based on a mistaken analysis of force or power. The present
  analysis avoids any use of Psychical forms in the concept of
  power. In keeping with that analysis, we should say that intensity
  and tendency in the observer are experienced in conjunction with
  certain Psychical forms, and that they are legitimately inferred
  in the projectile in conjunction with the forms appropriate to
  bodies and to power as physical. If this analysis is correct,
  power exists in unconscious matter. A further development of
  this argument will be made in the systematic theory of matter.
  (99, 100)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The last of the four
  areas, the metaphysical, in keeping with its high generality,
  consists of power as such, which is power prior to or abstracted
  from its commerce with form. Because of its combination of the
  indeterminate and the infinite and power, primordial power may
  be thought to be the object of mystical experience. As the final
  chapter of this book will show, mystical experience is devoted
  to the holy, which often is thought to have infinite power, and
  the experience approaches the holy as indeterminate. But primordial
  power is not the proper object of mystical experience. In addition
  to power indeterminate and infinite, the holy must have valuation
  and love, both of which imply mind. Primordial power has neither
  valuation nor love. If mystical experience were directed to primordial
  power, it still would not be able to relate it to finite powers
  and subsequent formations of power, for these require the category
  of determination, which is found in sensation and introspection
  and reason but not in mystical experience. (100)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">To reach finite power,
  unformed, the knowing mind takes the clearest instance of formed
  power, and abstracts from it the forms in question. The clearest
  instances are found in introspection of feeling, and probably
  of feeling as pleasurable. Granting that tendency and intensity
  in feeling are mingled with pleasure and other forms, attention
  can be focused upon them in their own natures. The attention
  is an act of abstraction amid full attention to the concrete
  particular of intensity and tendency. It yields presently to
  conceptual abstraction, which turns from the particular to words
  and universals for the benefit of communication and theory. The
  conceived object is then generalized throughout the areas of
  power, to form the concept of finite power as such. The warrant
  for the reality of power at the metaphysical level is thus found
  in introspective experience, which supplies something that thought
  cannot invent; in thought processes of attention and conceptual
  function, which reduce but do not invent; and in the thought
  process of generalization, which may invent a locus for the generalized
  nature, but is disciplined by two considerations: that power
  can be without producing form, and that such power is continuous
  with power experienced or scientifically inferred. Power in the
  metaphysical area does not transcend the realm of nature; on
  the contrary, it is the natural cause of the changes and forms
  which complete the catalog of nature. (100, 101)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">4. Power and Substance</FONT></B></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Power, primordial or
  finite, is substance or a substance, and constitutes the necessary
  and sufficient condition for substance. The concept of substance
  is not popular in philosophy of the last hundred years, and has
  been criticized by philosophers as diverse as Nietzsche, Whitehead,
  and Russell. The criticisms are directed to substance as metempirical,
  or as transcendent of change and alien to it, or as transcendent
  of change and related to it by an arbitrary factor. All three
  criticisms are directed to the bifurcation of what is into substance
  and the domain of nature. The analysis that follows will attempt,
  using the concept of power, to avoid the bifurcation and the
  criticisms. (101)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A limited conception
  of substance is found in common and scientific thought. It is
  probable that in both areas the concept begins with the experience
  of comparatively great endurance: a table is more substantial
  than its color or gloss because it endures while these fade,
  and a chemical element is more substantial than a compound because
  it endures amid changes of the compound. Power is the most enduring
  of beings, except for change in general, because it antedates
  and survives specific positional changes and all forms. The exception
  is made for change in general due to the reciprocal relation
  of change and endurance pointed out earlier: power can be without
  change, but neither it or any other being can endure apart from
  change. And change can not be without something that endures.
  That something, in its greatest generality, is power. The power
  that is the source of change endures amid changes, for the intensity
  and tendency that bring about changes remain unchanged in their
  nature. Power is the subject of endurance and the source of change
  in two interdependent moments, or aspects, of its nature and
  being. Here there is no bifurcation between power as substance
  and as source of change. (101, 102)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Common thought also identifies
  substance with support or substrate. A table is thought to support
  and underlie its color and shape, and the latter are thought
  to need such support. The spatial connotation of underlying,
  or of substrate, is misleading, for the relation of the table
  to its color is not the same as the relation of the table to
  the paint that immediately has the color, and reflective thought
  may extend the notion of support to the relation of feeling to
  its qualities, where the spatial implication is absent. More
  difficult is the fact that the table as supporter contains forms
  that define its wood material to the biologist and the chemist:
  either these forms need support, or the color and shape do not.
  A genuine distinction between supporter and supported can be
  found only in the distinction between the finite powers that
  &quot;inhabit&quot; the table and the constellation of forms
  that define the table from the subatomic level upward. Power
  then emerges as substance in the sense of support of related
  forms. But the notion of support is obscure and correspondingly
  arbitrary, once the spatial metaphor in it has been removed.
  The immanence of power in its changes is all that can be retained
  of that notion. Power as support of changes and forms is power
  as immanent in them. Again there is no bifurcation of power as
  substance and change. (102)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Common thought goes no
  further with substance than endurance and support. Reflective
  thought makes two further steps. As the third criterion of substance
  it asserts the notion of originative cause. Power has that status,
  since a given power does not depend on any other being for its
  causation of change, but causes change by the inherent tendency
  of intensity toward change, unless another power restrains it.
  This is to say that power is the sufficient condition for its
  operation in regard to change. The originative status does not
  separate power as substance from change, since power operates
  through the tendency toward change which is intrinsic to intensity.
  And that status does not isolate powers from one another, as
  though they were islands in an impassable sea. Deplorable as
  compulsion is in the domain of mind, it signifies contact between
  powers. Furthermore, single powers do not produce forms. It will
  be stated later that form is produced by the encounter of powers.
  (102, 103)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The final trait that
  may be ascribed to substance is that of self-caused or uncaused
  cause. This has to do not with the operation of power but with
  its being. Evidently power can have no external cause for its
  being. An external candidate without power would be powerless
  to generate power. An external candidate with power would not
  be external to power as such in the mode of primordial power.
  It would be external to another finite power, but it could not
  bring the latter into being. It would have only its tendency
  and intensity with which to produce another power; but its tendency
  is toward positional change and not toward the generation of
  other power; and its intensity could at best be divided into
  two powers, whose nature as power would not be brought into being
  by the division. Power therefore has no external cause. But a
  cause of power may be sought within power, leading to the thesis
  that power is a self-caused cause. This thesis requires a cause
  and effect duality within power. The duality usually assumed
  by the thesis is one of idea and reality, or essence and existence,
  or possibility and actuality. The duality probably may be reduced
  to that of essence as possible and as actual. The difference
  between an essence as possible and the same as actual is not
  in the essence, lest an impossible essence is actualized. It
  can lie only in the abstract difference between possibility and
  actuality. The causal function of possible essence thus can belong
  only to the possibility. This will belong to all possibilities
  or none. Since no one will agree to the first, the second must
  be granted. The possibility of power contributes nothing to the
  actuality of power, and the notion of power as a self-caused
  cause collapses. This is no problem for power as substance. Power
  needs nothing but itself for its nature and being, and no explanation
  can be given for them. Power is an uncaused cause. This status
  does not separate power from the domain of nature and change,
  since it has no bearing on the operation of power. (103, 104)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The criticism of substance
  as metempirical does not apply to power. Endurance is an empirical
  concept and can be ascribed to power if power is experienced.
  If the discussion of power in this chapter is correct, the immanence
  of power in its positional changes and the inherent tending of
  intensity toward change are experienced in the Psychical and
  psychophysical areas. The immanence and inherent tending are
  the bases for the substantial functions of support and originative
  causation. Only the last criterion of substance, having to do
  with its self-caused or uncaused status, passes beyond experience.
  The first of these alternatives is eminently rationalistic, since
  it deduces being or what is from their mere possibility. The
  theory of power does not claim that prerogative for reason. In
  this theory, substance can be revived without damage to empiricists
  or naturalists. The doctrine of substance completes the statement
  of the meaning and reality of power. (104)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
