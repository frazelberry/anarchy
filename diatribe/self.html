    <P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;<B>A fews
    years back, in Dicken's England</B>,</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">
    there were a bunch of educated fellows known to us today as </FONT><B><FONT
     COLOR="#990000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Philosophical Radicals</FONT></B><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">. Radical for their time, I guess; today
    we know them as stodgy conservatives. But in their time, at the
    dissolution of the church and feudalism, they were on the side
    touting freedom and liberty. Their world issued the promise that
    every man was free to work for whomever he wanted; and any employer
    could hire and fire at will.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Whereas, in feudalism, the economy
    was organized according to location or ownership of the estate
    - so whoever was so located became part of the parcel - this
    freedom on the part of the employer was pretty radical, indeed.
    For he need have no guilt and was under no obligation to provide
    subsistence to anyone who did not earn it. . </FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">But these guys were really optimists,
    you know. And they had a pretty ominous task. What could replace
    all these institutions which had previously dominated society,
    as that society began to loosen up in free wheelin' capitalism?
    They had to come up with something. And so they girded up their
    loins, so to speak, and touted self-interest. Yes, a whole bunch
    of individual self-interested entrepreneurs would save the day,
    they thought. Today, we call this <I>trickle- down</I> or <I>diffusion
    theory</I> in economics. These go getters, in go getting their
    own, would create jobs and spend money and everyone would be
    better off. Self-interest, then, would replace loyalty; desire
    would replace faith. They were really pretty courageous, these
    guys.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">And they had a definite feeling
    about this individual self, the </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">new king</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">.
    Now, I do not wish to romanticize feudalism. Nor do I wish, really,
    to strengthen the state. To the contrary, I am going to do something
    even more radical than they, for I wish to dethrone even <I>this</I>
    king. I wish to question whether even such a king <I>exists</I>.
    This may seem pretty silly, a grown man questioning whether your
    or his self exists. And yet, it is important; because if this
    self is running the show, it may prove useful to really identify
    and come to know it, do you think?</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">So, it can't be that hard. Each
    of us has some sense about this - about who we are. We remember
    our childhood; we prepare for old age; and it is <I>we</I> who
    do this, right? But who is this <I>we</I> anyhow? If we really
    reflect back to our childhood and take each segment of our life
    and really examine it, where is the <I>we </I>that continues
    as a stable identifiable thing? <I>We</I> have undergone a lot
    of changes, haven't we? Gone are the days when we had acne; when
    our shoe size changed seasonally. Now, maybe it's our waiste
    size that changes. Our teeth turn yellow and our hair falls out.
    </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">What a mess!</FONT></B><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> We no longer hang out with the same crowd;
    we don't enjoy the same music; we don't think the same thoughts,
    each one rapidly replacing the last one like mental popcorn.
    Our likes, dislikes, beliefs, disbeliefs, everything changes.
    Our lover tells us, &quot;You're not the same person I married.&quot;
    Face it sweetheart, neither are you. We hang onto a name like
    a label sewn in a frayed coat: while what it refers to is a little
    unravelly.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Within this continuous state of
    transformation, we may come to identify some patterns: propensities
    and inertia. And we - and especially our friends - may identify
    certain characters. But even so, as one notices a particular
    attribute, in that same noticing it is apt to disappear, replaced
    by something quite contrary, only to resurface later and far
    away. They are like waves rising and falling on a vast ocean
    of being. It is like sometimes we stand; sometimes we sit. If
    we ask who you are, you may say, &quot;I am sitting.&quot; But
    then, you may stand up. These things change. People change. Friends
    become strangers and strangers, enemies. And even enemies can
    become friends.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">We are quick to take credit, most
    of us, and very reluctant to take blame. If something is wrong,
    we will find excuses - it's my parent's fault; it's not me talking,
    it's the bourbon - but if we can put the blame on someone else,
    we're heading up the lynch party. Maybe we should think about
    this.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Many of us have some notion of
    an ultimate judgement. And we think, maybe if we're good in an
    ultimate way, we will ultimately go to heaven. And there we will
    find love ones who departed before us, waiting for us at the
    gate. But, in this meeting, how would we recognize them? Would
    they be wearing their Sunday best or casual attire; will they
    have blond hair or gray; will they be two-legged or eight-legged?
    It is reasonable to question these things. We buried their skeleton
    in a box and covered it with dirt; or burned it in a pyre; or
    threw it into the Ganges. What is left to recognize after this?
    And how will we, ourselves, be known?</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">After looking around for this self
    for some time, and looking back a little at what is looking,
    we may observe very vast composites of ideas and sensations.
    In the midst of this there does, and should, reside a </FONT><B><FONT
     COLOR="#990000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">discriminating wisdom</FONT></B><FONT
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> - a rudder within the gale. This wisdom
    can examine the contents of consciousness and establish a proper
    path. But this is not the same as self or self-interest. To the
    contrary, it is only when we <I>really</I> find freedom - when
    we break the bonds of our rigid identities and narrow views -
    does this wisdom really show itself. It is when we examine and
    finally admit that this very self for whom we have struggled
    and slaved, worried about and defended for so many years doesn't
    really even exist in any stable identifiable way that we are
    <I>really</I> free. And we can see beyond our own narrow concerns
    to a vast interaction of being. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS">This is<B> wisdom</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">And, far from becoming less responsible,
    we become <I>infinitely</I> responsible. Rather than self-interested,
    we become motivated in the interest of others. This is rather
    profound, don't you think? I didn't think it up myself, but I
    did think <I>about</I> it. And I can say that it can stand the
    test of scientific investigation.</FONT></P>

    <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;The
    continuous effort to understand the world has carried us far
    way from all those obvious ideas. Matter has been identified
    with energy, and energy is sheer activity; the passive substratum
    composed of self-identical enduring bits of matter has been abandoned,
    so far as concerns any fundamental description. Obviously this
    notion expresses an important derivative fact. The modern point
    of view is expressed in terms of energy, activity, and the vibratory
    differentiations of space-time. Any local agitation shakes the
    whole universe. The distant effects are minute, but they are
    there. The concept of matter presupposed simple location. Each
    bit of matter was self-contained, localized in a region with
    a passive, static network of spatial relations, entwined in a
    uniform relational system from infinity to infinity and from
    eternity to eternity. But in the modern concept the group of
    agitations which we term matter is fused into its environment.
    There is no possibility of a detached, self-contained existence.
    The nature enters ino the nature of each thing ....</FONT></CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;The
    fundamental fact, according to the physics of the present day,
    is that the e<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->nvironment with
    its peculiarities seeps into the group-agitation which we term
    matter, and the group-agitations extend their character to the
    environment. In truth, the notions of the self-contained particle
    of matter, self-sufficient within its local habitation, is an
    abstraction.&quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> </FONT><FONT
