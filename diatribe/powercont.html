<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Power is the primary carrier
or vehicle of being: there is no being apart from power. &quot;
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><A HREF="berndt02.htm#anchor102863"
TARGET="_top">(Berndston, 1981; p 44) </A>In our study of organizations
- such as the human being and his psycho-socio-physical environs
- we cannot help but grapple with power. Power is the stuff that
binds and directs, that gives form to bodies, corporations and
nation states. The channels in which it flows might be an organization
chart or a molecular structure. It's inertia is control; its impetus
is change. Power can be oppressive or revolutionary. It can be
vast and primordial, like the universe itself; or it can be as
miniscule as the quanta of an electron. It holds planets in thier
orbits, and persons at their tasks. It can be brutal or benevolent.
There is no being without power, but there are many different
meanings to the term.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">What we have in mind here
is a particular power - power of human kind. Individually, this
power is called &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;liberty.&quot; Collectively,
it can appear in various forms from autocracy to anarchy, which
can be generally termed &quot;necessity&quot; indicating the limits
to individual freedom. The historical notions of free and unfree
are positions on a spectrum; Ultimate freedom for an individual
is not known to us. Ultimate freedom would be like primordial
power - a universal being having no limiting edge to power or
horizon to consciousness. All beings who stand in relation to
this One would be strictly unfree, fatalistically determined;
all activity, position and feeling would arise causally from this
One. Casual observation, however, of the multitude of mistakes
and mishaps that define the human experience will attest to some
lattitude of freedom within the realm of necessity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">An &quot;individual&quot;
as such is defined by its freedom. To the extent that they are
simply the outcome of previous causes and conditions - like a
bud to a limb, limb to a stem, stem to a seed, etc. - the concepts
of individual and its freedom are highly abstract if not fictitious.
Each of us owe his or her very existence to other causes. Gravity,
solar radiation, water and climate come together within very narrow
thresholds (e.g., + or - 100 degrees celcius) of life support.
Our consciousness also depends upon objects and sensations. Our
thoughts rest upon our culture and its language. Personality forms
within a narrow mileiu of social norms and suggestions. As producers
we are constrained by what others purchase. As consumers we are
constrained by budgets and by what is available, and manipulated
by marketing and fashion. Yet from a very early age, we are each
of us cantakerous and rebellious. &quot;No&quot; will pop out
of an infant's mouth soon after &quot;mama.&quot; Even if we are
not free, we certainly aspire to be. This rebelliousness must
arise from somewhere internal to our psyche. No authority would
knowingly have taught it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Within certain discussions,
the notion of &quot;free will&quot; is debated: are we to be punished
for our own sin or for original sin; for &quot;who is without
sin?&quot; Free will is not the same as freedom in a social or
political framework. One may have remorse or regret for an action
one must perform for fear of reprisal. Whether one performs the
prescribed action and feels remorse, or doesn't and is punished,
indicates a limit to individual freedom in a social setting. While
at the same time, that very act of remorse validates freedom on
another level. Conversely, where one's society allows freedom
of thought or religion but one is seduced by sensationalism, there
is political freedom, but psychological bondage. For freedom to
truly manifest in a position of power - as in a creative or spontaneous
act - there must be a congruance of outer and inner freedom.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Creativity is not only
individual power - an expression of art, language, technology
or design - it is the underlying impulse of the universe. Rampant
creativity may give rise to hedonistic chaos; more likely it pressures
the existing structures of collective power, e.g., chieftans,
lords, kings, congress or corporations. Thus a counter-power is
employed to suppress such individual expression using either violence
or the threat of violence. To the extent that creativity is perceived
to threaten social cohesion - which is necessary to humanity -
it also elicits counter-forces irrespective of politics. Violence
may arise for a lack of norms; or violence may become normative
in itself. More subtle, although not necessarily less brutal,
forms of social oppression are verbal, e.g., slander and sarcasm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Or creativity can be controlled
economically, where the &quot;starving artist&quot; goes commercial
for example. Where creativity translates into economic use, it
becomes technology enhancing the productivity of labor, capital
or natural resources. Or it can be marketable in itself - usually
by rote or mass production. Economic development relies strongly
on this expression of individual innovation in the market place
and it does best where societies and their governments allow more
rather than less individual freedom. At the same time, however,
this freedom is constrained within purely economic values. Whether
innovation is rewarded or punished it is not entirely free. The
plight of universities illustrates this clearly. Money flows into
sports and business colleges, not into liberal studies or cultural
arts. For universities to survive as such, noneconomic values
must share part of the collective power structure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Ideas - the content of
mind - also arise and are shared socially. The individual may
presume to shape his or her own ideas in the &quot;privacy&quot;
of mind, representing a final sancturary of freedom. But we also
know of synchronicity of ideas and archetypes arising in seemingly
separate streams of thought. Our private feelings and emotions
overlap and can be communicated and understood between us, with
or without words. We can catch each other within our webs of fiction,
giving rise to cults, social movements, political parties and
nation-states. Our different sciences and schools of thought demand
conformity to its own lineage of references, jargon, and an increasingly
microscopic outlook on things. But more important is what we deem
as particularly horrific to humankind: <A HREF="war.html" TARGET="main">war</A>,
ethnic and sexual hatred and <A HREF="bully.html" TARGET="main">violence
among children</A>. These do not arise from nowhere. They arise
from our own mind: shared mind - human consciousness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The individual is affected
by many forces. He or she is not a separate entity, but a set
of relations within a greater set. Those relations internal to
the individual may be chaotic or oppressed - psychotic or neurotic,
respectively - or they can find a balance within an enlightened
regime as in wisdom. Each of us has the capacity for hatred, for
jealousy and pride. We also know compassion and grief. We can
be lasivious or loving. For the individual and for humanity to
find power, it must first look within itself. To the extent that
it is subject to other forces which are obscure and untempered,
it has no power at all. Without the legitimacy of individual power
- the spontaneous expression of the human being - there is no
legitamacy of collective power for humanity as well. Necessity
without freedom is oppressive - power for the sake of power: a
game of tokens.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Thus in our discussion
which follows, we will take a path from the microcosm to the macrocosm,
from personal to collective powers. It is hoped that at the end
of this discussion, we will have an idea as to how to achieve
harmony with a purpose, that is: to evolve personally and planetarily
with a minimum of violence. </FONT></P>
