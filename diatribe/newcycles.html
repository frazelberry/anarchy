  a British big guy - they dub 'Sir' - who in the Great Depression
  era proposed that a nation-state, which controls the production
  of money anyhow, could borrow up the kazoo and spend it in ways
  that would get businessmen off their tuffs and their machines
  cranked up and people back at work and everybody would be happy
  again. At that time, though, it took Hitler to get politicians
  off their tuffs first. This time around it took <B><U><A HREF="http://www.dnaco.net/~bkottman/reagan.html">Ronald

  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Reagan himself,
  of course, praised 'supply-siders' - it would be investors who
  led the expansion, he promised. But investors themselves relied
  on a large federal deficit and low interest rates to create a
  huge sum of money to invest. As long as wages are kept down,
  and it isn't taxed, most of it remains as profit to be reinvested
  again and again at a feverish pitch, raising - as we have witnessed
  - a lot of bull in the stock markets.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Theoretically,
  Keynes is quite right. If one conceives of a national - or, presently,
  a global - economy as a vast economic machine, like a table saw
  or tractor, it is quite logical to borrow to buy that machine
  provided it can produce enough money to pay back its loan and
  hopefully make a little extra. In this same way, <A HREF="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opd.htm">a
  huge federal deficit </A>feeding a rising stock market creates
  more taxable revenue which, even at reduced tax rates, can pay
  off that debt and maybe earn a little extra. But, as with the
  table saw or tractor, a prudent businessman would hope to do
  so before it is junk. This is where the notion of business cycle
  is so important. <!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--></FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We have, as a
  nation-state, reached the level in this economic expansion -
  this business cycle - that we no longer have to borrow to charge
  it up. On the basis of these higher earnings, the President and
  the collective Congress are able to put forth annual budgets
  which are approaching some balance - but we have yet to reach
  a point where we begin to pay it off. The critical factor in
  this grand enterprise is its duration, after which we again have
  to borrow to 'prime the pump.' Being so heavily invested in automobiles
  and warheads, we should consider this cycle not, as is the basis
  of election year strategists, as lasting 5 - 20 years, but consider,
  as did the <A HREF="http://members.theglobe.com/taodesigns/nforrestertxt.html"
  TARGET="_blank">Nathan Forrester</A> model, in terms of century
  or two.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Many commentators
  today have taken to speaking of the business cycle as if it had
  its own life of its own, like a god or demon. But in fact it
  is a composite of many factors - technology, which is to say
  a particular mix of capital and labor, geopolitical stability
  or lack thereof, and <A HREF="http://www.ciesin.org/">environmental
  constraints</A>. An ill or illiterate population, for example,
  would likely have an affect on economic production, as would
  a polar meltdown.</FONT></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>
