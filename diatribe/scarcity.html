  Thomas Malthus - that British chap who drew the distinction (1798)

  an exponential growth curve of the human population.</FONT></P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">There
    are, says Malthus, only three ways in which the population can
    be kept down; they are: moral restraint, vice, and misery. Of
    moral restraint on a large scale he has little hope until all
    the population shall have been educated in the true principles
    of political economy. Of &quot;vice&quot; he cannot, as a clergyman,
    speak otherwise than in terms of reprobation; moreover, ... he
    does not expect it, at most times, to be very effective. He proves
    that the losses caused by epidemics are soon made good, and he
    concludes that misery is the chief preventive of excessive population.
    It is because people die of hunger that the population is not
    greater than it is. (p. 77)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But,
    it may be said, if there are more people to work the land, it
    can be made to produce more food. Why then should an increase
    in numbers cause any one to starve? At this point, the argument
    depends upon what was afterwards called the law of diminishing
    returns. ... (p. 77)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Those
    who form the poorest class in a society must, so Malthus contends,
    be as poor as is compatible with survival, since otherwise their
    numbers would increase until that point had been reached. ...
    It is therefore a good thing that some are richer than others,
    for, in any system of equality, all would be at the lowest level;
    on this ground he rejects the schemes of Godwin, Owen, and other
    reformers. 'It is absolutely certain,&quot; he says, 'that the
    only mode consistent with the laws of morality and religion,
    of giving to the poor the largest share of the property of the
    rich, without sinking the whole community in misery, is the exercise
    on the part of the poor of prudence in marriage, and of economy
    both before and after it.&quot; Malthus thus makes a clean sweep
    of all schemes of human amelioration which fail to tackle the
    population problem. ... (p. 78)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">There
    is, he maintains, no right to support: if a man cannot live by
    his own exertions, or if a child cannot live by the exertions
    of its parents, the community is under no obligation to provide
    subsistence. (p. 79)</FONT></P>
    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The advantages
    to the community which flow from individual selfishness are repeatedly
    emphasized by Malthus; it is for this reason that a beneficent
    Providence has made us all such egoists. But the egoism that
    does good is of a special kind: it is prudent, calculating, and
    self-restrained, not impulsive or thoughtless. Malthus himself
    had three children in the first four years of his marriage, and
    after that no more, owing, on presumes, to &quot;moral restraint.&quot;
    Mrs. Malthus's opinion of the principle of population is not
    recorded. (pp. 79, 80)</FONT></P>

  Thus starvation set the limits to economic growth, or to human
  society as we know it. The model was sophisticated and expanded
  in work by Jay Forrester (1972) in </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><A
  HREF="../jforrester/jforrestertxt.html" TARGET="_blank">World
  Dynamics</A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">.
  Here, however, the notion of moral restraint is cast on those
  better off who - because of their economic position - are scarfing
  down everybody else's dinner with their own. Moral restraint
  is, in either case, an unlikely event.</FONT></P>

   COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> credits Malthus
  with the first global model, but refutes his conclusions by the
  growth of scientific knowledge and what he called &quot;class-one
  evolution.&quot; The plutocrats (Hoover Inst., et al) don't like
  any notion of monkeying around with markets. They pooh pooh such
  hand-wringing with the usual argument that they underestimate
  the technical coefficient of capital. And this has historically
  proved good in some locations. Mechanization, economies of scale
  and distribution have staved off starvation for the most part.
  The rising tide of population has been met with a rising tide
  of scientific applications. And in any case, nobody is starving
  in <U>their</U> neighborhood. Admittedly, the models are a little
  too global in character, and too apolitical. It is easier for
  someone in Texas to refute Malthus than for someone in Bihar,
  for example. Moreover, a quarter of the world's population lives
  in China, operating under some different set of rules from the
  rest of us.</FONT></P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The basic rule
  of the price system is scarcity</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1"
   FACE="Comic Sans MS">. If everything was as available as air
  (currently), no price would obtain. A price may arise where scarcity
  occurs in a specific location - as in the case of water, which
  is plentiful for the planet but lacking in the Sahara. Similarly,
  while the planet receives an abundant stream of energy from the
  sun, its conversion into stocks of petroleum, coal and timber
  are made scarce by our dependence on them. And, while the planet
  appears vast enough to anyone who has travelled about, particular
  areas are made scarce by a lattice work of wire and asphalt.
  These indicate that scarcity is not a law unto itself, but a
  subjective relationship of space and time.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The universe,
  in itself, offers no practical limits. What we call &quot;universe&quot;
  - all that we can see both day and night - may be only a locality
  of space/time in a greater scheme. One contemporary notion -
  an offshoot of inflation theory - is that what we call Universe
  is only a part of an infinite ocean of universes of greater or
  lesser duration rising and falling like waves. This resembles
  Buddhist cosmology which speaks of a three-thousand fold universe
  - meaning 1,000 to the power of 3, or 1 billion universes - coming
  and going concurently through eternity.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The mind,
  too, is just like this. In itself, there is no limit to what
  one can experience with the mind. Each of us have our unique
  experiences; a culture shares some common tones; each specie
  of being has its own range of perception and focus. And the mind
  accomodates every one of them. The mind doesn't care, really,
  what you put into it. You can be crazy as a tack or straight
  as a nail. You can believe in one thing, its opposite, or both
  at the same time. The mind doesn't care. But we narrow its vastness
  through the force of habit and attachment and all that we righteously
  or gullibly believe.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">When
  we speak of scarcity, we are reducing our scope to what is meaningful
  to us; and the most meaningful of all is the scarcity of one's
  own life. &quot;There are not enough hours in the day,&quot;
  we say, &quot;There are not enough days in the year.&quot; Now
  another year older, in desperation, we may try to fill our days
  with stimulation and activities, stash away anything, everything
  we can lay our hands on. And we can never get enough. Like the
  squirrel gathering acorns for winter, most of us are saving up
  for retirement, enfeeblement or death. For most of us, this is
  the real meaning of scarcity.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But this
  desperate consumption is also a fabrication of social myths.
  We invest so much meaning in what we own. As </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"

  (1927) </A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">stated,
  &quot;only a human lifetime in the past it was futile to double
  the wages of an agricultural laborer in Silesia who mowed a certain
  tract of land on a contract, in the hope of inducing him to increase
  his exertions. He would simply have reduced by half the work
  expended because with this half he would have been able to earn
  twice as much as before&quot; (Weber, pp354, 355) Today, by comparision,
  there is never enough. And by this notion, scarcity is multiplied:
  we spend so much time pursuing things we have even less time
  than before.</FONT></P>

     FACE="Comic Sans MS">n so-called civilized societies it is the
    poor who spend their days in an anxious search for the means
    to live and the rich who can indulge in gratuitous activities;
    but when we compare rich and poor societies, the reverse often
    appears. The isolated communitites, when they were discovered
    and brought into the frame of reference to national income per-head,
    were placed very low on the scale, yet for many of them the proportion
    of energy, skill and mental activity devoted to non-economic
    aims was much greater than it is with us. (</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">One of
  the richest experiences I have had - that stands out in my memory
  - is a large wooden porch in front of the store in a small mountain
  town; sitting on the bench there, as folks wandered in and out
  through the wire-spring screen door. Large wooden porches are
  pretty much a thing of the past, but it used to be quite popular
  to wave to your neighbors as they passed, a generation ago. Now
  we use surveillance cameras in front of rod iron, to protect
  - you know - all these things.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">They're
  very meaningful to us - these things. To us, to our friends and
  family and people at work, and people we pass on the road - these
  things signify our life. If you were to look around your room
  right now - assuming the room is somewhat your own - the objects
  around you tell a story - a personal history, a relationship
  to yourself. Just as you create meaning into your environment,
  so do you define yourself by things.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">And the
  reason for this is very simple. We are relational beings, not
  isolated blocks of wood floating around in space. We are seeing-
  hearing- tasting- smelling- touching- thinking beings, which
  is to say, <U>concious</U> beings. We are related to all things
  - subject to object - intimately, as neither can exist alone.
  (At least, as far as we know.) That we even have a notion of
  being indicates a consciousness of it, of all these things that
  make up our experiences - whether we own it or not, whether it
  moves with us - like a thumb or thigh - or whether we leave it
  behind like a neighbor. All these compounded consciousnesses
  of being is the very stuff I call my &quot;self.&quot; Or, this
  is how it seems to me.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Contemporary
  economics would like to avoid all this of course. It doesn't
  want to acknowledge consciousness anymore than modern psychology
  will admit a psyche. Economics can only speak of &quot;utility&quot;
  when discussing objects - a purely mechanistic view, like something
  internal to an object. It doesn't even want to admit to desires,
  wants or wishes, but can only quantify &quot;demand&quot; which
  sounds really spartan. What bunk! Check it out yourself. A cup
  on a shelf in a store is not the same as a cup on a shelf at
  home. That junk in the attic is infinitely more valuable than
  the same junk at a public landfill. One has a relationship to
  me, while the other does not.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">And so
  like magicians we continuously redefine ourselves with the objects
  of our experience. The more we stack up around us, we create
  kind of a buffer - an illusion of safety and stability in a changing
  world. It is an illusion, after all. No matter how much we lubricate,
  keep dusted or locked up, much as we fuss and fight it, things
  have a way of wearing down or walking off. It isn't sinister
  or mean - this stuff - it just doesn't really exist the way we
  want. Even were we to run off to replace it - a new home, new
  car, new wife - won't help for long. And even for the time it
  did, we would be hankering for something else.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This
  is the psychology of scarcity, you see - Gestalt psychology.
  One thing emerges from within the field of our experience - moves
  front and center - some need or want. And when we satisfy that
  experience, a new one emerges. We eat until full, and then we
  need a nap. When we wake, we're off to the races to find gratification
  in some other far flung thing, which makes us hungry again. In
  this respect, Malthus is certainly right - we can never eat enough.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We eat
  and eat and eat and eat and sleep and sleep and sleep, scratch,
  sniff, snort and sneeze, time after time without end, and we
  never find any lasting satisfaction. Some would say this recurs
  lifetime after lifetime for as long as we can imagine, but in
  any case it is true for all of us here. So maybe it isn't things
  we really want. Maybe what we want is more like <U>happiness</U>
  - a subjective condition - which we can only try to approach
  with these things.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">What
  is happiness, then? Freedom from fear, from torment and terror.
  Freedom from conflict both inner and outer. Freedom from stress
  and struggle. Freedom to express and consider. Happiness has
  to be a little related to these. We all need food, to be sure
  - a condition of ourselves as relational beings - we are not
  self-contained or -sufficient; we cannot exist alone. But can
  we exist without conflict? Can we work without effort, and live
  without fear? Wouldn't this make you happy?</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Freedom
  in its broadest sense means existing without limitations, like
  if we were to drop all boundaries and barriers. Already there
  is fear - isn't there. What would this be like? Here comes the
  Hobbsian man - the felon, the mad murderer-lawyer-rapist. That
  is our prediction - our anxiety. Maybe, though, it would be more
  like Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu or Guru Nanak Dev. Maybe Einstein
  or Planck, Mozart or Monet. Our mind follows our attention -
  if we focus solely on money we can get rich; if we focus solely
  on benefiting all others, we can become enlightened.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We need
  both courage and reason to move beyond our narrow spheres of
  fear, and our notions of time and scarcity of things. Scarcity
  is an aspect of causality. If we plant only onions, we can expect
  a scarcity of potatoes, for example. If we put all our time into
  surfing the web - or invest solely in the new information age
  - we can expect to get a little hungry. But the information age
  does offer the potential to dissolve barriers, or it may not,
  depending upon our interests. And, since you have managed to
  read this far - instead of browsing for porn - you have justified
  my hope. By you, humanity can make it. And we can make it good.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Oh yeah.
  Those forecasts - by the way - of Malthus and others are true
  for a lot of people and other species. And you are responsible
  to do what you can to save them. But you are responsible to do
  much more - to make them free and happy.</FONT></P>
