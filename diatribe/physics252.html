<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Matter Waves and the de Broglie Hypothesis</FONT></P>

<P>The Bohr postulates were more or less without justification.
The concept of a stationary state<BR>
seemed useful, but the reasons for the existence of such a thing
were not readily apparent. The view<BR>
of particles as classical objects did not seem to imply stationary
states. However, such is not really<BR>
the case for wave-like quantities such as light. It was known,
for example, that light could make<BR>
'standing wave cavities' which looked something like what a stationary
state should look like. In<BR>
one dimension, such a standing wave cavity is easy to comprehend.
We have light of wavelength<BR>
lambda that must 'fit' inside a box of length L. This o<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->nly
happens when an integral number of<BR>
waves fits within the box. Otherwise, the wave would 'interfere'
with itself. This leads to a natural<BR>
quantization - only certain wavelengths are allowed in the box.
Lasers are predicated upon this<BR>
fact. All of this begs the issue of the wave-particle duality
of light, but remember that light does in<BR>
fact exhibit both wave and particle properties. </P>

<P>The de Broglie Hypothesis</P>

<P>Recall the Planck/Einstein energy/momentum/frequency relationships
for photons/light waves: </P>

<P>                              <IMG SRC="deb1.gif" WIDTH="229"
HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>These relationships embody the essence of the wave-particle
duality - they relate wave-like<BR>
quantities like frequency and wavelength to particle-like quantities
like photon energy and<BR>
momentum. Given that light has particle-like qualities, it may
not be so surprising that particles<BR>
might have wave-like properties. After all, we can think of a
photon as a particle with zero rest<BR>
mass. In his doctoral thesis, de Broglie had the insight that
if one could associate wave-like<BR>
properties with particles, then the quantization postulated by
Bohr in his explanation of atomic<BR>
spectra might be justified. de Broglie hypothesized relationships
for particles which are formally<BR>
very similar to those above for light: </P>

<P>                      <IMG SRC="deb2.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="171"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>A significant difference, of course, is that the photon relationship
between energy and momentum,<BR>
E = cp, is more complicated for particles. Probably the most revolutionary
aspect of the de Broglie<BR>
hypothesis is the first of these equations - that every particle
has a wavelength which is inversely<BR>
related to its momentum. </P>

<P>This hypothesis, which is now generally accepted, obviously
does not match our everyday<BR>
experience - massive particles do not oscillate like a wave. Let
us see why. </P>

<P>Find the de Broglie wavelength of an object with a mass of
10^-6 g and a speed of 10^-6 m/s. Note<BR>
that this is a very small particle that is moving very slowly
and thus has very small momentum. We<BR>
would expect that the de Broglie wavelength might be substantial.
In fact, given that h =<BR>
6.6x10^-34 J s, we find that the de Broglie wavelength is 6.6x10^-19
m! This is four orders of<BR>
magnitude smaller than diameter of a typical nucleus (not an atom,
which is 6 orders of magnitude<BR>
larger yet). The value of h is just so small that anything larger
than an atom will always have an<BR>
unimaginably small de Broglie wavelength. It would be difficult
indeed to detect such a small<BR>
wavelength. </P>

<P>Quite the opposite is true for a low energy electron. Consider,
for example, an electron with an<BR>
energy of 13.6 eV. We have found that this is the binding energy
of the n = 1 electron in hydrogen,<BR>
and it is thus an energy which is typical of electrons in atoms.
This energy is small compared to the<BR>
rest mass of the electron, so we can calculate the momentum classically:
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="deb3.gif" WIDTH="560" HEIGHT="188" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>                                                          
            </P>

<P>Substituting K = 13.6 eV, we find a de Broglie wavelength of
0.33 nm = 3.3 Angstroms. This is<BR>
small, but it is comparable to atomic dimensions so that it can
in fact be detected and measured,<BR>
as we will discuss and demonstrate shortly. </P>

<P>De Broglie Waves in Atoms</P>

<P>Let us presume that the de Broglie is correct, and that the
electron orbiting the nucleus in<BR>
hydrogenic atoms follows this relationship. In order to have a
'stationary state', we need to satisfy<BR>
the same sort of quantization condition as light in the 1D box
discussed above. The difference is<BR>
that our box is not linear, it is in a circle. Specifically, we
require that we have an integral number<BR>
of de Broglie wavelengths in one orbit: </P>

<P>                                  </P>

<P>The left side of this equation is, for a circular orbit, simply
the angular momentum. We thus<BR>
recover the Bohr quantization hypothesis from the de Broglie relationship.
</P>

<P>You should not take this calculation too seriously. Despite
its ad hoc nature, however, it must have<BR>
some bearing on reality. The wave nature of the electron must
be related to the quantization<BR>
apparent in atomic spectra. In later years, you will learn much
more about this relationship - this<BR>
is the basis of quantum mechanics.
