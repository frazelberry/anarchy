<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">War,</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">
in the sense of armies strutting about </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Comic Sans MS">capturing surrounding territories, is probably
pretty much obsolete - save one or two rogue nationalists. Power
remains a function of territory only in such areas like urban
planning, ranching and football. Otherwise, it is a function of
exchange - in markets - and is, by its very nature, disperse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The shift in economies
from agriculture and cottage industry to one of global markets
have blurred the boundaries of most regions of the world. In a
large region, the inner core may still present more of a national
or local flavor, but the periphery is a location of trade, of
coming and going, and will assume a more international taste.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The greatest opportunity
for violent conflict, therefore, is not along boundaries between
regions, but within them - as in ethnic or separatist movements.
Similarly, military regimes are not so concerned with foreign
invasion, as with domestic law and order. But when the military
joins the frey, as in <A HREF="http://www.intac.com/PubService/human_rights/balkans/"
TARGET="_top">Bosnia</A> and <A HREF="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Country_Specific/Rwanda.html"
TARGET="_top">Rwanda</A>, the order is ethnic genocide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This depiction presumes
regions in the traditional sense of periphery and core, - like
an area and its surface - as was the case when markets formed
along coasts. With air travel, interstate highways and internet
connections, these regions fracture into clusters sometimes conceived
as webs and nodes. The nodes align themselves (or have been aligned)
vertically in an economic process called &quot;development.&quot;
While the web - or core area - radiates horizontally - sometimes
remaining nonaligned, or even maligned from this economic hegemony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The popular notion of
these nonaligned nationalists is that this hegemony extends from
the United States. And there is some basis for this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The two primary means
a nation state has over its regions is control over its population
- through domestic legal authority and migratory visas; and the
nationalization of money. Its currency is both a nation's obligation
to the market system, as well as its prerogative: &quot;Give to
Ceaser what is Ceaser's.&quot; Thus, a government taxes only that
money which it alone produces. The American dollar has been the
preferred medium of exchange in many international markets for
quite awhile, which gives it an economic influence throughout
the world. Moreover, those dollars provide a rich tax base with
which the United States has established a formidable military
defence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But it is a defence not
of its territory, which has not been attacked since Independence.
Nor is it a defence of its people, despite a nominal democracy.
Rather, the US military is an assumed function of the global market
- to provide security for exchange and for property. Iraq can
attack unarmed Kurds and Shiites as far as the US is concerned
- no problem - but Kuwait is altogether different. It is a difference
of periphery and core.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But, while the medium
of exchange may be the dollar, the language spoken in international
trade is usually English. It is also the customary language in
the United States, which exposes that the hegemony applies to
the US as well; for this hegemony is not a national one, but a
<U>rational</U> one. The market system - the system devised by
the Englishmen Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Hume, John Maynard
Keynes, et al - is a hegemony of the mind, what I have called
&quot;modern conservatism&quot; or &quot;rational idealism.&quot;
It belongs to no particular location.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Thus, in the United States,
the core areas are increasingly aligned along its interstate highways.
McDonald's, WalMart, Office Depot, Cracker Barrel, ABC, NBC, Microsoft,
Intel, Nike, Classic Rock, and Easy Listening, dominate the landscape
around every clover leaf exit. Back on the two lane roads, you'll
find mostly Country on the air waves; some folk will wave back
at you as you pass - Friendly Folk - as long as you're a lot like
them. Otherwise, it's best to get back on the highway and drive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Here's the rub. Vertically,
we are aligned in top /down - dominace/ dependence fashion: employer/employee,
banker/debtor, etc. And its really two dimensional. Periphery,
like surface area, has no depth, no resonance. It's like a face
you put on to meet the public. Like a dealer's fast-talk smile.
And no body trusts it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Horizontally - where the
heart beats and blood runs red with life, stories and myths -
we have all this ethnic conflict and violence. It is like without
some parent figure with a nuclear arsenal breathing down our neck,
we're a bunch of unruly kids. Much as we resent being oppressed,
we hate each other even more. So you and I - as neighbors, or
married couple, or Isreal and Palestine - are so filled with self-righteous
hatred we have to pay some lawyers to work it out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">And yet, however much
the core needs the periphery, the periphery needs the core even
more. This rational hegemony - the economic wherewithals of life
- is not sufficient for humanity. Life is more than occupation,
or so it should be. We need our myths, our stories, our art and
spiritual inspiration to give our life meaning. We need each other
as family and friends, not merely salesmen and consumers. It is
this longing that has revived such cultures as the Native American
and Raggae. It is in everyone's interest, therefore, to resolve
this bitterness and strife.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">To this end we can continue
to apply the tools of oppression, or to learn those of cooperation
- hegemony vs community. Community development does not mean infrastructure,
like drainage ditches and power lines. It doesn't require any
new capital spending or increased taxes. To the contrary, it requires
the removal of old stuff - barriers and boundaries we spent generations
trying to defend, and at what cost? Not just lives lost in terms
of killing each other, but lives lost in such pointless activity.
A total waste of time. Community requires that we recognize those
things we have in common, and value those that make us distinct.</FONT></P>
