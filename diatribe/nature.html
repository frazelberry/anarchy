    <P>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Much of the
    theory of rational materialism derives from the notion of nature
    </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">-- as in the nature
    of man, the nature of the universe, or as a natural law. The
    rationality of their argument hinges upon the belief, nay the
    faith, that their principles are universal and natural - inherent
    in the object of their discourse, not merely in the discourse
    itself.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">And the nature they perceived
    in mankind has not always been a pretty sight. They perceive
    themselves in a perpetual struggle to survive at odds with all
    other persons struggling to survive, and the survival of each
    depended upon strength and cunning relative to the other. (note:
    these theories precede Darwin, and they are of the same culture)
    Two granddaddies of the social theory of materialism - packaged
    today as</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Modern"> </FONT><B><FONT

     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> - were the Englishmen, Hobbes
    and Townsend.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Hobbes argued for a tough
    governing order to maintain civil order. Townsend championed
    the laissez faire - the notion that there are natural forces
    at work to maintain order- i.e, starvation - such that no state
    intervention is required. In either case, it did not behoove
    anyone to &quot;abet the enemy&quot; as it were, by providing
    assistance to those in need. Jeremy Bentham, following the debate
    concluded: &quot;In the highest stage of social prosperity...the
    great mass of the citizens will most probably possess few other
    resources than their daily labor, and consequently will always
    be near to indigence... (therefore) the task of the government
    was to increase want in order to make the physical sanction of
    hunger effective&quot; (Bentham quoted in Polanyi)</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This beast-like view
    is culturally perpetuated, as witnessed in the entertainment
    industry, video games, in classrooms and the nightly news. But
    is it really our nature?</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Looked at from
    a very narrow view</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">,
    all of us are engaged in a self-interested motive to survive.
    We are born, we live a life of stress and struggle, and then
    we die. From this view, life is very tragic, indeed. With a little
    broader view, we include our ancestors and descendents into the
    picture. Then we see the continuation of technology and arts,
    material well-being, living beyond our own feeble frame and giving
    a worth to all the struggle and stress; and so we may die with
    some satisfaction leaving our attachments with those to whom
    we are attached. At a greater scope, we may have a belief in
    a God or some other just restitution - a final release from our
    limited view after death. We feel that this will invest meaning
    to our life.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Still this is a limited
    scope. It is concerned with one life, one death, and only those
    closely connected to it. At a broader scale - a universal scope
    - one can see that beings live, beings die. This body dies; this
    body is born. What we see when we view beyond a narrow attachment
    to self is a vast harmony; a balance. All of us eat to live;
    my exhale is our inhale and vice versa; we also defecate fairly
    regularly and eventually give up the ghost to others. One can
    view this process as a struggle, or as a reciprocity of being.
    You can view your being on this planet as a inherited treasure
    to be protected from all other beings, or as a great debt to
    all other beings for allowing you to be. This is a greater scope.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But still we are discussing
    view, not nature.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Rational
    Materialism presumes that we can </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"
     SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">really</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Comic Sans MS"> come to an objective knowledge of things
    by viewing them &quot;objectively,&quot; i.e., as mere objects,
    like isolated bits of matter. And yet, if we really look into
    these hard discrete material building blocks - called matter
    - if we really analyze down to their nature, we really don't
    find anything. At least, not anything isolatable and hard. It
    is really more like a systemization of energies or forces - as
    in <A HREF="http://www.cyborganic.com/People/gizard/Tibud/Mad/mad12.html"
    TARGET="_top">probability waves</A> - giving rise to temporal
    patterns in space. These are perceived by a consciousness as
    various shapes, textures, colors, sounds, etc., and they are
    imputed with meaning by intellect. Things as such - as what we
    experience - are inseparable from view.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Nature - as an objective,
    absolute or ultimate reality - is knowable only when consciousness
    transcends its own narrow view: as when the knower, the knowing
    and the thing known are identical. This is the Orient's view
    of Enlightenment. In the Occident, on the other hand, &quot;Enlightenment&quot;
    is applied to the fall of the Church, the rise of market-economy,
    and the deification of ego and rationality. The modern paradigm
    is the liberalization, not the transcendence of view; it is in
    no case ultimate or objective. It more like the view through
    a multifacted crystal: the more individuated, the more facets.
    We cannot find its nature without first admitting and then examining
    the nature of mind itself.</FONT></TD>

     FACE="Comic Sans MS">If, to Hobbes, man was as wolf to man,
    it was because outside of society men behaved like wolves, not
    because there was any biological factor which men and wolves
    had in common. .... But on the island of Juan Fernandez there
    was neither government nor law; and yet there was balance between
    goats and dogs.... No government was needed to maintain this
    balance; it was restored by the pangs of hunger on the one hand,
    the scarcity of food on the other. Hobbes had argued the need
    for a despot because men were like beasts; Townsend insisted
    that they were actually beasts and that, precisely for that reason,
    only a minimum of government was required. ... No magistrates
    were necessary, for hunger was a better disciplinarian than the
    magistrate.... &quot; </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><A
