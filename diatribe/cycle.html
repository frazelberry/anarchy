  <P><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Modern Conservativism
  has its profits.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">
  There are some prophets these days who, seeing the game has changed,
  preach that the business cycle has vanished.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">There are many
  business cycles - when the shop owner arrives in the morning,
  and turns his door sign to &quot;Open&quot;, he begins a new
  business cycle. And when he turns the placard over in the evening
  to read &quot;Closed&quot;, the business cycle has ended. On
  Monday morning, many people begrudgingly get into their automobiles
  and race off to begin another work week - another business cycle
  - and celebrate the coming weekend when they get their paycheck
  and go out dancing for a change.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Another business
  cycle concerns the investment of capital. When a businessman
  buys a new machine, he does so to produce something which, hopefully,
  will make a enough dough to pay off the machine and a little
  extra before it is junk. That is <I>its</I> business cycle.An
  economy - the agglomeration of such businessmen, their and workers
  and customers - goes through a similar process. One literate
  fellow by the name of <B><U><A HREF="schumpeter.html">Joseph
  Schumpeter</A></U></B> thought about this for a long time <A HREF="http://www.wiso.uni-augsburg.de/vwl/hanusch/iss.htm"><IMG SRC="schumpeter.jpg" WIDTH="150" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="211" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A>ago, and speculated that there are large
  business cycles determined by technological change.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The automobile,
  to give an example, is itself business cycle. In the beginning,
  there was oil. It was determined that oil could be refined to
  produce an ignitable liquid, the ignition of which could propel
  a vehicle across land to transport people in discrete and disperse
  little missiles rather than along a long rail. People could go
  about anywhere they want to, provided there were stretches of
  road and places to fill up along the way. And so this created
  a market - a whole economy revolving around a gas driven automobile
  - which required mechanics and transmission shops, drive-in restaurants
  and automatic tellers, shopping malls with lots of paved parking,
  and complex matrices of freeways sprawling to distant suburban
  housing additions and faster cars so that people could speed
  between there and here and back again, and of course the medical
  and insurance industries to patch them all up again when they
  propelled themselves into each other. According to Schumpeter,
  all these things taken together are a cycle, which ends when
  another technology comes along to replace it.</FONT></CENTER></P>

  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">- this new prolonged
  expansion attributed to either the new monetarism or Reaganomics
  - can be more understood in terms of Keynes. </FONT><A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Economists/keynes.html"><B><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">John </FONT></U></B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"><IMG SRC="keynes.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" WIDTH="116" HEIGHT="151" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT><B><U><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Maynard Keynes</FONT></U></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> </FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">was
  a British big guy - they dub 'Sir' - who in the Great Depression
  era proposed that a nation-state, which controls the production
  of money anyhow, could borrow up the wazoo and spend it in ways
  that would get businessmen off their tuffs and their machines
  cranked up and people back at work and everybody would be happy
  again. At that time, though, it took Hitler to get businessemen
  off their tuffs first. This time around it took <B><U><A HREF="http://www.dnaco.net/~bkottman/reagan.html">Ronald
  Reagan</A></U></B>.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Reagan himself,
  of course, praised 'supply-siders' - it would be investors who
  led the expansion, he promised. But investors themselves relied
  on a large federal deficit and low interest rates to create a
  huge sum of money to invest. As long as wages are kept down,
  and it isn't taxed, most of it remains as profit to be reinvested
  again and again at a feverish pitch, raising - as we have witnessed
  - a lot of bull in the stock markets.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Theoretically,
  Keynes is quite right. If one conceives of a national - or, presently,
  a global - economy as a vast economic machine, like a table saw
  or tractor, it is quite logical to borrow to buy that machine
  provided it can produce enough money to pay back its loan and
  make a little extra. In this same way, <A HREF="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opd.htm">a
  huge federal deficit </A>feeding a rising stock market creates
  more taxable revenue which - even at reduced tax rates - can
  pay off that debt. But, as with the table saw or tractor, a prudent
  businessman would hope to do so before it is junk. This is where
  the notion of business cycle is so important.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We have, as a
  nation-state, reached the level in this economic expansion -
  this business cycle - that we no longer have to borrow to charge
  it up. On the basis of these higher earnings, the President and
  the collective Congress are able to put forth budgets approaching
  some balance - but we have yet to reach a point where we begin
  to pay it off.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The critical
  factor in this grand enterprise is its duration, after which
  we again have to borrow to 'prime the pump.' Being so heavily
  invested in automobiles and warheads, we should consider this
  cycle not, as is the basis of election year strategists, as lasting
  5 - 20 years, but consider, as did the <A HREF="../nforrester/nforrestertxt.html" TARGET="_blank">Nathan Forrester</A> model, in terms of century
  or two.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Many commentators
  today have taken to speaking of the busi<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->ness
  cycle as if it had its own life of its own, like a god or demon.
  But in fact it is a composite of many factors - technology, which
  is to say a particular mix of capital and labor, geopolitical
  stability or lack thereof, and <A HREF="http://www.ciesin.org/">environmental
  constraints</A>. An ill or illiterate population, for example,
  would likely have an affect on economic production, as would
  a polar meltdown.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The last big dip</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> in our national business cycle
  occurred when the Arab OPEC nations instituted an embargo of
  crude oil in the 1970's. This was a political change - a residual
  tremor from a neo-colonial to a global economy - rather than
  a technological one. Political in nature, it also proved very
  practical. It drove a response to make efficient use of it where
  oil was consumed; while at the same time extending the earning
  stream where it was produced. In the short term, though, there
  were profits to be made.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Industry specific
  profits were called <I>windfall profits</I> and were nationalized
  through taxation. But there were other ripples in the fabric.
  The sharp rise in oil prices sent waves of price increases throughout
  the economy. Rising prices - called <I>inflation</I> - were matched
  by rising wages to keep up living standards among folks grown
  particular to having them, which fueled higher prices and wages
  and so on. There was not much profit in all this activity, any
  rise in price was consumed by wages and everything had to be
  adjusted back to some &quot;real&quot; measure of money. But
  this is precisely where the real profits lay.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Real estate became
  the profiteer's boondoggle, for it had a relatively fixed supply.
  And as anyone with a college education knows, where there is
  increased demand in a market with fixed supply, the effect is
  rising prices. All the money pouring into the housing market
  fed an inflationary frenzy which its investors sought to hedge
  by pouring more money into the housing market. It is like a chain
  letter - a bubble profit - a shell game of smoke and mirrors.
  It promised quick double-digit profits and was very nearly risk
  free - because it was all insured by the <B><U><A HREF="http://www.fdic.gov/publish/slchron.html">FSLIC</A></U></B>.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The inflation
  rate for real estate at this time was higher than the composite
  index, and in many communities higher than the interest rate
  of these FSLIC- insured loans. This meant that a person could
  borrow a hundred thousand dollars and pay back later in dollars
  worth only maybe ninety-five thousand, then sell the house for
  more than he put in just by letting it sit idle while prices
  kept rising. This is a pretty good deal, don't you think? Well,
  it was until Jimmy Carter did a very nasty thing. He appointed
  Paul Volker to the federal bank.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The federal bank
  basically controls how much money can be lent out by all the
  little private banks in the country. When banks can't get all
  they want, they raise the interest rate they have to charge their
  customers. When the interest rate rose above the inflation rate
  in this bubble market, the bubble profits burst. Hey, no problem,
  they're insured!</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We don't talk
  about where the profits were taken, but<IMG SRC="homelesskids.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="167" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
  the debt was distributed to every tax payer in the country from
  now until doomsday. And the FSLIC - originally intended to provide
  loans for family homes - is no more. But the <B><U><A HREF="http://www.ahandyguide.com/cgi-bin/catch2.cgi?data=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ahandyguide.com%2Fcat1%2Fh%2Fh186.htm&Template_b=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fetc%2Fhttpd%2Fhtdocs%2Fcatch%2Findexadd.txt&Confpage=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fetc%2Fhttpd%2Fhtdocs%2Fcatch%2Findexadd.htm">homeless
  problem</A> </U></B>remains.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">By the end of the century</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">, the situation is different.
  Inflation is not a factor in most sectors of the economy. But
  what about stocks? We don't call it inflation, we call it profit;
  but how much of the bull in the stock market is new production
  capacity, and how much is old stock being traded? The distinction
  is important. Prices for stocks will rise just by introducing
  more money - a result of lower tax rates, especially on capital
  gains - independently of real productivity gains.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">When a new idea
  comes onto the market - like a start up company going public
  - its initial offering is bought up by big investors. However
  many shares at whatever price the big guys offer is what the
  company has to spend on long-term production. The big guys will
  then turn around and broker it to all the little investors buying
  and selling in the open market. The big guys aren't doing this
  for the company - they have their own business, which is brokering.
  They're going to offer less than what they themselves expect
  to get. And so on for subsequent layers of buying and selling,
  until the price settles down. The more money introduced into
  the system, the greater the price on any given stock will be.
  In the process there is a lot of profit taken, but the company
  bought and sold is pretty much out of the picture from the first
  go round. All subsequent profit is speculation - stock market
  inflation.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Companies, too,
  can buy and sell stocks in their own or other companies. Even
  having a bank account is financing a brokerage firm somewhere.
  Any one who holds cash in savings, especially long term deposits,
  is likely to benefit from a rising market to a limited extent.
  But even so, to increase productive capacity, you eventually
  have to take money out of speculation and invest it in real productive
  capital. You can't keep it in the form of cash, and you can't
  keep buying and selling.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">These days the
  Dow Jones average is blipped across every tv screen and radio
  wave. A mild eupohoria has captured the minds of the rational
  idealists. This is, indeed, their hey day. Like all chain-mail,
  the illusion will last as long as someone keeps buying it. Anything,
  however, - and this is the point - can come along and end it.</FONT></CENTER></P>
  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">There is a real
  capcity there in the market - much innovation and hard work -
  it is well for everyone to want to prosper. But these speculators
  are like those who inflated the real estate market before. And,
  as before, it is not they who will most likely suffer. It will
  be those who can bear it least - who form the lowest ranks of
  the job market.</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">'The collapse
      in the stock market in the autumn of 1929 was implicit in the
      speculation that went before. The only question concerning that
      speculation was how long it would last. Sometime, sooner or later,
      confidence in the short-run reality of increasing common stock
      values would weaken. When this happened, some people would sell,
      and this would destroy the reality of increasing values. Holding
      for an increase would now become meaningless, the new reality
      would be falling prices. There would be a rush, pell-mell, to
      unload. This was the way past speculative orgies had ended. It
      was the way the end came in 1929. It is the way speculation will
      end in the future.' (J K Galbraith, <U>The Great Crash</U>, pp.
      23-4)</FONT></CENTER></P>

  <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">It need not end
  this way. It is up to you. When you buy stock in a corporation,
  pick something that humanity will need in the future. Have the
  certainty then that you have invested in your children's children
  or the kids across the street. Rest with that quiet confidence
  that the market will bear you out and that you will receive your
  due. Don't be swayed by fast talkers or quick returns. Stay true
  to your own heart. How can this be wrong?</FONT></CENTER></P>
