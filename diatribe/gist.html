    <P>&nbsp;<FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Whatever
    we think</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> about our
    social polictical economic <I>blah blah blah</I>, is conditioned
    by what we think about ourselves. What is such <I>blah blah</I>,
    but an external arrangement between many of us who are more or
    less the same? There are many possiblities here, really, for
    this understanding of our own humanity - our human nature.</FONT></P>

    <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">And if you grew
    up, as I nearly did, you studied historical theory and accounts
    describing humanity as a bunch of murderer- rapist- thieves banding
    together waving flags, wearing this or that funny outfit, slaughtering
    someone on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">the
    <B>other side</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">.
    This kind of historical reporting is much the same as our current
    news. If you stay at home a lot and watch the local news for
    information about whatever city you live in, you start putting
    up security systems and iron bars on the windows and purchase
    a gun with which you or your husband or children can injure each
    other and cause severe rifts in your household. All you will
    know about other people around you are that they are murderer-
    rapist- thieves.</FONT></CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But is this really
    the case? Or is it more like when we go to the cinema to watch
    some action packed film with lots of explosives and brash sex
    and people with their heads hacked off. How often do you see
    stuff like this when you're out shoppping, for example? Rarely.
    And if you do, I suggest you seriously consider moving. No. We
    go to such cinemas precisely because these things are <I>not</I>
    experienced daily in our city streets. Just as we watch the news
    to learn about things we wouldn't know otherwise. And so it is
    with history. If it were reported to young school children that
    most of the time, their ancestors were really more preoccupied
    with growing food, providing shelter, paying bills, etc., these
    poor school children would never pay attention to anything we
    taught them.</FONT></CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This is not to
    say that the world has been a bed of roses, either. Each of us
    have a lot of bad habits. People have a habit of creating confict
    with each other. But this is precisely because we tend to view
    ourselves as individuals engaged in some kind of conquest against
    other individuals who are engaged in the same conquest against
    us. Whereas most of the time, we rely strongly upon one another
    for our very survival, as well as emotional comforts and mental
    knowledge. Our bank of technology is an accumulation of works
    over many generations and cultures, not oneself alone. Such technologies
    include language by which we speak to one another, as well as
    gestures, altars and arts. We do not merely exchange money, we
    exchange <I>values</I>; and much of that value is determined
    by our consideration for <I>others</I>.</FONT></CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">But, as a result
    of much misinformation about ourselves we have devised a great
    scheme of interactions and have incorporated them into our daily
    lives: the masks we portray to each other in conversations, the
    manner in which we drive our cars, the rhetoric of our politicians,
    and so on. We pay homage to the fiction of the competitive will
    in each of us, ambitions and an individual <B><A HREF="self.html">person
    </A></B>or <I>soul</I> who manifests great achievement in strife
    with everything else.</FONT></CENTER></P>

    <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">I propose that
    the reality that makes all this possible, that provides each
    of us with a continuation of our lives and standards of living,
    and maintains our humanity in all of its splendor, is not these
    individuals out there slugging their way through a marketplace.
    Rather, it is our commonality and cooperation.</FONT><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">

    looking at things, I will present my own historical accounts,
    pyschology and personal reflection.</FONT></CENTER></TD>
