 >Following the course
  of Newton and Descartes</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" >,
  Alfred North Whitehead laments that Newton introduced forces
  which "left Nature still without meaning, or value. In the
  essense of a material body-- in its mass, motion, and shape--
  there was no reason for the law of gravitation." Hence,
  to Whitehead, "a dead Nature can give no reasons. All ultimate
  reasons are in terms of aim-at-value. A dead Nature aims at nothing.
  It is the essence of life that it exists for its own sake, as
  the intrinsic reaping of value" (Whitehead, 1934; 8,9).</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Whitehead raises the
  notion of an "absoluteness of self-enjoyment", which
  is to praise the subjective end of things. From the dead Nature
  of Newton, he proposes the idea of 'creative advance'. By this
  he means the "process of eliciting into actual being factors
  in the universe which antecedently to that process exist only
  in the mode of unrealized potentialities. The process of self-creation
  is the transformation of the potential into the actual, and the
  fact of such transformation includes the immediacy of self-enjoyment"
  (Ibid; 26, 27)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >And this is the turn
  we shall take here. Development - economic growth - is usually
  presented quantitatively: as a percentage change in the National
  Product, or as capital accumulation or return on investment.
  Similarly, it is assumed that such development is produced quantitatively
  from economic factors. This is the bulk of economic theory.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Development is also the
  spontaneous expression of society, with or without economists.
  An economy is not just mathematical fiction, but the coordinated
  effort of humanity striving towards a goal. That goal may be
  vague and inarticulate - as in "betterment" - or deliberate
  and reported - as in a war effort or space program. And it can
  be scrutinized qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The feverish
  development of weaponry, for example, is qualitatively different
  from the same rise in basic needs.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial><B><FONT SIZE="-1" 
 >Life and all that
  we perceive derive from particular organization</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" >. It is the organization which
  gives us value and meaning. All things have an inside and an
  outside, preconditions and effects; and it is in relation to
  things, to other people and other living creatures, that we define
  ourselves. There is no individual in a Newtonian sense - no discrete
  atomic building block. There are only boundaries of organization.</FONT></FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Organization is modeled
  in 'loops' or in composite loops called 'systems'. Behavior is
  conceived as process within a structure, but this structure is
  also a process of another structure, ad infinitum. Being and
  becoming, structure and process, are defined by an intended boundary
  of explanation. There are countless systems owing only to the
  boundaries intended and the processes captured therein. Structures
  refer to the system's separation from its environment (our limits
  of explanation) which become its static quality. The processes
  captured enable an analysis of the system's dynamics - its functional
  change. All systems are, accordingly, both static and dynamic.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >So let us begin to re-ravel
  the knots. The knots will here pertain to a social and economic
  organization. We must first have a notion of the individual.
  Let us hurriedly specify that the individual is composed of "inner
  personal tension", borrowing from Kurt Lewin:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Using the construct of
    a "system in tension" for representing psychological
    needs definitely presupposes a field theory. Conceptually, tension
    refers to the state of one's system relative to the state of
    surrounding systems. The essence and the purpose of this construct
    is to include a tendency for change in the direction of equalization
    of the state of neighboring systems. The construct, therefore,
    presupposes a geometric representation of the person and a distinction
    of functional subparts or "systems" within the person,
    with a definite position in regard to each other...... (Lewin,
    1951; 11)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The hypothetical person
  is described also within an envrionment, and the environment
  is more of concern to us here. But the environment necessarily
  imposes meaning on the individual, and that individual (owing
  to his own directive) strives for such meaning. Hence, a relation
  attains a degree of stability-- a steady state. Lewin brings
  us back to Culture:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >One should view the present
    situation - the status quo - as being maintained by certain conditions
    or forces. A culture - for instance, the food habits of a given
    group at a given time - is not a static affair but a live process
    like a river which moves but still keeps a recognizable form.
    In other words, we have to deal, in group life as in individual
    life, with what is known in physics as "quasi-stationary"
    processes. (Lewin, 1951; 173)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Here we may specify the
  variables in our model for economic development. These are of
  two kinds to represent both structure and process. The static
  element is represented in a variable termed 'level', 'state',
  or 'balance sheet,' depending on the system under investigation.
  A second variable, the action variable, is also termed differently
  according to area of study, e.g., 'rate', 'flows', 'profit and
  loss.' Action variables depend upon the level variables, and
  level variables change magnitudes through the action variables.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Through the course of
  social and economic understanding there have been organizational
  forms which stress the level variable over the rate variable,
  and vice versa. The first instance is typically characterized
  by the 'household', or any other budgetary organization including
  also a governing body, or non-profit organization. This is the
  process of a system which consumes from its environment for reproductive
  value: the state of stability. It should be noted that all organizations
  strive for some degree of stability or cohesion, but this is
  inevitably compromised by its need for purpose.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" >  <FONT face=Arial>The 
  purposive organization associated with surplus production for exchange is 
  peculiar to modern rationality. It is founded historically on the concept of 
  'Capital Accounting' defined by Weber as "the valuation and verification of 
  opportunities for profit and of the success of profit-making activity. It 
  involves the valuation of the total assets of the enterprise, whether these 
  consist in goods in kind or in money, at the beginning of a period of 
  activity; and the comparison of this with a similar valuation of the assets 
  still present or newly acquired, at the end of the process" </FONT>

  macro-representation of the flows within a structure is the Leontief 
  'input-output' model. The I-O model is essentially a matrix relation of 
  factors of production generally represented by industries or sectors. The 
  internal flows are determined by the technical coefficients which remain 
  fixed, assuming constant returns to scale in all sectors. The magnitude of 
  flows is demand determined: households and government are exogenous, i.e.,

  increase its dynamism. Finally, it is also conceivable to append Outcome to

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Janos Kornai, a Hungarian
  economist, placed emphasis on the control and the flow of information.
  Accordingly, he is interested not only in the real processes,
  such as those represented in the input-output model, but also
  in the "control processes" which are of intellectual
  nature. Within the control processes he includes "observation,
  information transmission, information processing, decision preparation,
  and decision-making" (Kornai, 1971; 39).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Within both the real
  and control spheres are organizations with varying degrees of
  superordination and subordination. The control sphere generally
  controls the real sphere, yet within the control sphere there
  are also two types of superordination and subordination: one
  based on the right to command and subject to legal sanctions,
  the other based on monopoly of indispensable information. (lbid;
  77) We therefore introduce a mathematical 'partial preordering'
  within the set of economic organizations and weigh the relations
  according to level of influence. In addition to the directive
  functions, Kornai also recognizes the 'autonomous functions'
  based on the "average diligence, conditioning, routine,
  identification with one's job of the people working within the
  system' (Ibid; 178). This level of control is strictly horizontal
  in nature, and corresponds more closely to 'substantive rationality'
  in the economic process, as contrasted with 'formal rationality,'
  as distinguished by Weber:</FONT></P>

    face=Arial>The term 'formal rationality of economic action' will be used to 
    designate the extent of quantitative calculation or accounting which is 
    technically possible and which is actually applied. The 'substantive 
    rationality', on the other hand, is the degree in which a given group of 
    persons, no matter how it is delimited, is or could be adequately provided 
    with goods by means of an economically oriented course of social action. 
    This course of action will be interpreted in terms of a given set of 
    ultimate values no matter what they may be. ... </FONT>

  face=Arial>Moreover, the formal expression will be dependent upon particular 
  substantive components. Among these components, Weber mentions: 1) Market 
  competition among relatively autonomous units; 2) Money accounting, 
  specifically capital accounting mentioned above; and 3) production of goods in 
  a competitive market determined on the basis of 'effective demand'. By 
  effective demand, he means the "structure of marginal utilities in the income 
  group which has both the inclination and the resources to purchase a given 
  utility. This will depend upon on the distribution of wealth in a given 
  society" </FONT>

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The autonomous functions
  will, it is suggested, maintain only the status quo of a functioning
  system. They correspond to a particular 'gravity' which provides
  a system with its capacity to secure its existence: to survive.
  In Kornai's terminology, this is the 'primary adaptation'. 'Secondary
  adaptation' would then refer to attempts to achieve certain aspirations,
  expectations or norms. Secondary adaptations, then, require a
  higher, more formalistic function of the system.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Other models have developed
  to approximate the operations of an economy at varying temporal
  and spatial relations. One with particularly provacative impact
  was the Forrester model in the first Club of Rome report. This
  model propounded the so-called 'limits to growth' by incorporating
  technology, capital, population, and non-human resources within
  a closed system. It is illustrative of the 'global model' with
  a time span of approximately 200 years. The younger Forrester
  (1973) has developed a national model of the Canadian economy
  of approximately the same time span. Additional models have been
  introduced to specify regional interactions of shorter duration,
  e.g., Hamilton, et al (1969).</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Economic activity follows
    various cyclic influences. The common 'business cycle' consists
    of a period of roughly 3 - 7 years, and is reflected in the interactions
    between backlogs, inventory and employment. The 'Kuznets' cycle
    reflects the rebalancing of labor and capital and consists of
    approximately 15 - 20 years. In the longer run, we are more interested
    in the interactions within the capital-producing sectors. Here,
    we speak of the Kondratieff cycle, or economic long wave, lasting
    approximately 45 to 60 years. The long wave consists of an overbuilding
    of capital plant, followed by a wearing out and depreciation
    of that plant. The end of the capital construction phase is revealed
    where business-cycle activity becomes more severe, unemployment
    rises, return on investment declines, productivity falters, new
    innovation diminishes, speculative activity increases, prices
    and interest rates rise, and economies stagnate (Forrester, 1982).</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The Forrester model in
  World Dynamics (1971) represents the 'life cycle of economic
  development' lasting approximately 200 years, as indicated through
  shifting loop dominance. Positive feedback loops dominate the
  growth phase of development, while negative loops lie dormant
  within the structure. Accumulated growth, so the model assumes,
  will eventually trigger negative processes which bring the economic
  process from growth to steady state.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The succeeding limits
  are depicted as a "slow restriction of alternatives rather
  than by obvious trauma or collapse. Tradeoffs develop where choices
  were unnecessary during the growth phase" (lbid). The elder

    values and goals. The industrialized societies have become geared to a 
    philosophy of growth and rising standard of living for everyone. This cannot 
    continue indefinitely. New human purposes must be defined to replace the 
    quest for economic advancement. Nature must be helped rather than conquered. 
    Civilization must be restrained rather than expanded. Social pressures 
    probably must increase rather than decline, until those pressures can be 
    transformed into a change in social values that take satisfaction from an 
    equilibrium society. The underdeveloped countries face equally traumatic 
    changes in goals. They now aspire to reach the level of industrialization of 
    the advanced countries. But they may already be in better balance with the

  social order characteristic of our modern society has been attributed to the

  orients himself to his situation in terms of rational self-interest. 
  Rationality, on the one hand, obliterates the reliance on custom and tradition 
  and, on the other, places reliance on values which assume relative position 
  through individual competition and compromise. The rational age also 
  introduced concepts of society and individual. It was at this time that the 
  philosophers of Europe began to question the monarchy, not certain of its 
  replacement. The age started as a certain liberation-- as all social 
  transitions seem-- but it stabilized within a new order of relations. It 
  presupposed rational money accounting-- meaning effective prices determined by 
  a competitive market. Production was determined by demand to the extent that 
  it was 'effective' in the market. This means that it does not respond to 
  actual social wants "unless their possessors are in a position to make them 
  effective by sufficient purchasing power in the market" </FONT>

  face=Arial>Engels stressed the role of the modern state of producing order 
  from the irreconcilable class conflicts, and this by essentially oppressing 
  the ruled classes. And, with qualifications, this may be the case-- in the 
  modern state which rationalizes its existence on the principles of Engels 
  himself: the centrally planned socialist state. But society may be equally 
  heteronomously determined within a laissez-faire state-- as Weber points out-- 
  in a formally voluntary way. This is the case where unequal distribution of

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The traditional theory
  of development equated development with modernization, with developed-
  or modern-state refering to the accumulation of capital in concentrated
  productive stock structured toward the industrial process and
  exchange economy. The benefits of such concentration are to 'trickle-down'
  and influence the entire social system. The traditional systems
  would lose their power as the modernizing processes assmilated
  more and more of the resident populations: differentiating social
  activities, specializing economic functions, and offering contractual
  dominate - subordinate relations. The term 'diffusion', also
  'from-above' has been applied to this dissemination of development.
  It was based on twin assumptions of the system's benevolence
  and stability. It was considered to be both orderly and evolutionary.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >There were many terms
  used in describing the processes expected, most having synonomous
  implications. Hirschman (1958) suggested that key sectors be
  chosen for investment which had the most value on the basis of
  'backward- and 'forward-linkages' within the input-output model.
  This form of concentrated investment would allow the greatest
  return for public capital and managerial skills. Private capital
  was then invited to balance the input-output matrix, seizing
  on external economies and market demand. Furthering the concept
  of concentrated investment, the growth-pole concept-- which envisioned
  a 'spatial diffusion' of economic growth-- was introduced. There
  would be a 'filtering' of innovations down the urban hierarchy,
  as well as a 'spreading' of economic benefits from urban center
  to hinterland areas (Berry, 1972).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The economic cores are
  central to a 'nested hierarchy of spatial systems' (Hansen, 1981).
  Through communication and transportation, political administration
  and market monopolization, the dominance of the center over the
  periphery was cumulative. Within the formal rationality, it appeared
  the only way of articulating the development process and integrating
  the periphery into the market economy. Outside this formal rationality,
  we might expect some dissension which came from the sociological
  perspective.</FONT></P>

  THEORY OF DEVELOPMENT</FONT></I></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The other side of the
  top-down-diffusionist model is the dependency model in which
  development is seen as an essentially disruptive process which
  destroys traditional social organizations and assimilates the
  disorganized populations on unequal terms. Peripheral areas are
  seen as subordinated to the foreign metropolis, production becomes
  directed soley to an exchange market established in core areas
  with little or no regard for local self-interests or direction.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The diffusion of development
  envisioned for the peripheral areas provided both 'linkages'
  and 'leakages' to the external markets. Linkages refered to the
  downward transmission of consumer goods and services, not facilities
  for production. Production in the industrial mode requires a
  degree of scale both in managerial and capital factors. It also
  requires certain agglomerative economies for suppliers and markets.
  Leakages refered to reduced multiplier effects of decentralized
  investment whereby most of the full effect was displaced back
  to the center markets.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The national economy
  as measured in the formalistic economic methods refers to those
  sectors that are assimilated into the world exchange medium.
  In the poor agrarian societies this is an 'enclave' economy at
  best. With the expansion of the exchange market was the disruption
  of the traditional economy of rural industry and crafts and the
  dislocation of its productive elements. These elements were basically
  left to join the structurally underemployed in the metropolis.
  Taking the dependency theory to its conclusion, regional development
  should secure a dual process of selective closure to the exchange
  market coupled with the development of a use-valued economy which
  satisfies territorial objectives with its own resources. Most
  territorial objectives concern the provision of basic needs--
  e.g., nutrition, health care, education, shelter, etc. The resultant
  linkages and leakages then consist of activity impulses from
  below which feed into the market economy and may influence also
  the price-signals - hence, development - of the greater economy.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >As early as 322 BC Kautilya,
    the greatest economist and sociologist of the age, advocated
    a balanced economy, through regulating prices, standardising
    quality produce, nationalising mines and capital resources, harmonising
    relationships between ethnic and caste groups, safeguarding the
    interest of the wage-earners, utilising the irrigation and man
    power potentials and above all recognition of the services of
    individuals taking up community works. For the first time it
    ushered in a new era of collective enterprises in the rural sector
    for encouraging joint farming, joint management of irrigation,
    pasture land, educational and recreational activities. In the
    subsequent age, too, Asoka, the Piyadarsi, endeavoured to build
    up social integration by undermining the solidarity of the sacredotal
    Brahmanical class, and, exposing the hollowness of their complicated
    rituals. Earnestly he devoted himself to replacing the sacredotal
    cult with universally accepted values, like service to mother
    and father, teacher (guru), learned (Brahmana), cordial behaviour
    with one's asociates and respect and love for all creeds and
    creatures. These values he called 'Law of Piety', which he inscribed
    on rocks at all corners of his far flung empire in the regional
    script (Brahmi and Kharosti) and in the language of the elite-few.
    Needless to stress, the voice of humanity left by Asoka as permanent
    records in the lingua-franca of the country, was a positive step
    taken by him to bring into practice social reality and social

  village communities were virtually self-sufficient groups of

  for gain was not tolerated within the community., and its economy
  was directed by earnest interpretations of the Christian doctrine.
  The economic relations systematically introduced notions of cosmopolitan

    temperament come in. Some men are industrious and acquisitive, others 
    feckless, idle or generous. There is a certain tendency to check 
    accumulation. The richer family marries its children earlier, so that 
    numbers increase faster and land per head is reduced in the third 
    generation. But this tendency has generally proved too weak to offset the 
    forces pressing against equality. In a society which allows inequality of 
    possessions between families, it perpetuates itself. Those with excess land 
    can make use of the labour of others, either by employing them at wages or 
    letting land to them for a share of the produce. Either way, property

    Industrial labor, paid and otherwise exacted, will not disappear.
    But when development, wage labor and its shadow encroach upon
    vernacular work the relative priority of one or the other constitutes
    the issue. We are free to choose between hierarchically managed
    standardized work that may be paid or unpaid, self-selected or
    imposed on the one hand and, on the other, we can protect our
    freedom to choose ever new invented forms of simple, integrated
    subsistence actions which have an outcome that is unpredictable
    to the bureaucrat, unmanagable by hierarchies and oriented to
    the values shared within a specific community. (Illich, 1981;

  into useful worvers". (Illich, 1980; 5). The destitute still
  resisted such efforts to qualify them for work, and the community

  becomes more intense, the bureaucratic state is invited to take
  a more active role in structuring sectoral development. This
  implies a degree of regional emphasis which favors the industrial
  growth-core regions over the agricultural subsistence-peripheral
  ones. Within the core areas there are competing groups, establishing

  Unlike the Engelian conception of state as suppressing class

  requires that a political ordering of interests and a sequencing
  of their realization be worked out" (Das Gupta, 1981; 4).
  Specifically of rural impoverishment, he comments:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Consider cases where
    such ordering is easy because the dominant interests are highly
    congruent. Take the case of those poor countrires where mass
    poverty needs urgent attention. Most of the poor people in these
    countries are located in rural areas. The rural economy in poor
    countries based on a mixed economy is clearly dominated by higher
    landed interests. Depending on the degree of industrialization,
    the industrial part of the economy is dominated by a different
    set of interests. It is not difficult to see why landed interests,
    who in a large part have been instrumental in generating poverty,
    would have a political interest in maintaining rural poverty.
    Leading industrial groups may not feel so strongly about maintaining
    rural poverty, although the logic of cheap food supply and cheap
    labour supply may bring them politically closer to the rural
    landed groups. The peasant groups, however, have the advantage
    of numbers-- but this advantage is nullified to the extent they
    remain unorganized or unrepresented. Political authority in such
    situations would naturally reflect this balance of revealed interests.

  of any change in the structure itself, volumes will grow eight

  dimensions" (Boulding, 1972; 87). In social organizations,
  the limiting factor is communication-- particularly up and down
  the hierarchy-- which grows at a slower rate than the organization.
  The organization eventually will limit its growth by the simple
  difficulty in getting information from its environment to the

  reasserting its inherent meaning: the sense of 'commons'. Commons
  is expanded to specify that area composed of externalities -
  or shared-subparts - within our social milieu. We are gestalting'
  to the level of relations rather than of units. To further define
  the notion, let us consider community development as a process
  rather than as goal or method. This establishes certain qualifications:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
    AS A PROCESS. In this view community development moves by stages
    from one condition or state to the next; it involves a progression
    of changes in terms of specified criteria. It is, in this view,
    a neutral, scientific term, subject to fairly precise definition
    and measurement expressed chiefly in social relations: change
    from a state where one or two people or a small elite within
    or without the local community make decisions for the rest of
    the people to a state where people themselves make these decisions
    about matters of common concern; change from a state of minimum
    to one of maximum cooperation; change from a state where few
    participate to one where many participate; change from a state
    where all resources and specialists come from outside to one
    where local lpeople devise methods for maximal use of their own
    resources. The emphasis here is upon what happens to people psychologically
    and in their social relationships. ... (Sanders in Cary, 1970;
    19)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >By way of contrast, Community
  Development in terms of method or program has been implemented
  by government agencies, economic developers or other professional
  fields. The community to be developed in this design is usually
  defined by the instigating agency. Thus the goal is often equated
  to capital development, eg. infrastructure and housing. Process
  implies an instilling of community. By relying on vertical systems,
  the locality may not develop an internal organization. Some localities
  assume a functional relation, dominant or subordinate, in the
  hierarchical system (see Friedman and Weaver, 1979). The primary
  undertaking of community development is therefore community creation.
  A community is created by a commonality of objectives and an
  organized pursuit.</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The process then involves
    learning on the part of the people in the group and, if possible,
    on the part of other groups which may be involved: learning about
    the individuals themselves - by the individuals themselves -
    about the group and about their environment. This in itself entails
    learning skills of communication by members of the group. When,
    as a result, there is a clearer understanding of their attitudes
    toward one another and toward others outside the group, the question
    arises 'Where do we go from here?' By going through a process
    of group discussion, a set of objectives is formulated. At this
    stage it can be said that the group becomes a community; it shares
    not merely an awareness of tensions, but a conscious set of objectives
    which clarify the very identity and membership of the group.
    But while a community does not become a reality until a group
    of people have succeeded in agreeing on objectives, a process
    of development is taking place before the community is thus established.
    Development includes the prior process in which the initial problems
    and tensions are worked through by the people concerned and an
    identity of objectives is established and a community is formed.
    Community development therefore includes in its early phase a
    process of community creation. (Roberts, 1979; 35)</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >This meeting of minds
  may occur within one room or in the newspaper's editorial section,
  etc, depending upon the community in question. To realize its
  objectives, skills may need imparting. Such skills include simple
  record-keeping and methods of evaluation. Beyond within group
  organization, the group must attune to its environment. The dynamics
  of group behavior have been studied within this context and conclusions
  have paralleled the Indian concept of 'Bharahatvarsa'. Bennis
  and Shapard (1956) have traced the steps of power relations within
  a group. In this process, the early period is expressed through
  a dimension of dependence in various forms of 'flight' (essentially,
  escaping the groupness intended), then comes fight', meaning
  fighting between members and distrusting the group leader. Eventually,
  there emerges a stage of resolution, by pairing or by concentration
  on the group's objectives, and by developing an internal system
  of authority. Following this stage is what they call 'enchantment',
  where the members begin to share dominance and develop a sense
  of solidarity. Then comes the stage of disenchantment, where
  members begin to distrust one another and question the goals
  of the group. Finally, if the group develops this far, is the
  stage of 'consensual validation'-- personal ties diminish, there
  is a realistic acceptance of the group and a turning toward the
  external realities.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >For the displaced peasantry
  of modernizing societies, community organizations appear to have
  spontaneously evolved. Indications are that a degree of 'resourcefulness',
  as well as social and political participation, exists within
  some urban squatter settlements-- until the inhabitants lose
  their hope and energy in changing the political structures of
  the greater system. There is a growing trend therefore to adopt
  these organizations while initiating community development programs.
  A 1976 UN study suggests the initiation of such programs at the
  central government level, with local government acting as a communication
  link to these oranizations. Within this specification, it also
  stresses the need for bottom-level need prioritization:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Although basic needs
    and their order of priority vary among communities, there does
    apear to be a general pattern in the new slums and squatter settlements
    throughout the world. In most of them the residents, whether
    they hold legal tenure to the land or not, demand a piped-water
    supply, sewerage systems, health services and paved streets first.
    After these minimum utilities and services have been delivered
    to the communities, basic social needs form the next priority.
    Since most of the settlers come to these urban areas in search
    of work, jobs and the education that can lead to jobs are of
    primary importance. ... Other social needs include schools, day-care
    centres, public markets, healthcare centres and police protection.
    Finally - and only after all these other needs have been satisfied
    - the most highly developed of the low-income urban settlements
    begin to be concerned with environmental pollution and their
    lack of parks and other recreational facilities. ... Although
    surveys throughout the world have indicated that new housing
    is often in the last order of needs for low-income urban residents,
    it has only recently become apparent to planners that their massive
    investment in public housing for slum-dwellers was misdirected
    and has not contributed to the establishment of appropriate urban
    policies for low-income settlements. (UN, 1976; 15, 16)</FONT></P>

  for improving health care..." (lbid, 20). Within the Cartagena
  community in Columbia, work banks' were established to
  "loan equipment and tools, provide materials and money for
  individuals to initiate gainful activities and/or to improve
  their houses, list workers and employment openings and possibilities,
  and provide legal and other kinds of advice necessary for establishing
  and improving cottage industries and opportunities for employment"
  (lbid, 21). Another example is Guatemala City, where literacy
  classes were established with the aid of political organizers.
  In these the concepts of co-operative organization were introduced.
  The central political network shared information of such organizations
  throughout the city, which encouraged each neighborhood to participate
  within the "city-wide movement". (Ibid, 23)</FONT></P>

  cannot hope to survive in a hostile political structure. In the

    informationprocessing capacity: it is the extent to which there
    is a capacity to process a diversity of complex information which
    transcends strictly localized symbolic nuances. This is information-processing
    capacity's direct linkup with what in general terms is ordinarily

  sacrifice resources or immediate gratification for the welfare
  of others, out of a feeling of unity" (102). Further, within
  the communication linkages, some communities will be more integrated
  into the larger information system. Hence, a concept termed 'relative

  or "rhetorical participants are eliminated. Tullis
  also specifies a negative structural bind, in which village communication
  boundaries are hard and dualistic, social rigidities are intense,
  and the resultant pattern is community fragmentation and 'amoral
  groupism'. If the bind is of substantial positive magnitude,
  the peasants will be processing symbols not only in a "single

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >A successful peasant
    solidarity movement hatches two major offspring: (a) It increases
    the peasantry's capacity to handle (process) more information
    and symbols and thus allows the incorporation of more "meaning
    structures" into peasant life. The symbolic structure of
    the world which guides the peasantry becomes more complex - more
    "differentiated". ... (b) Such a movement also increases
    the peasantry's relative access to whatever information structures
    are availabe to the nation (or social subsystem) of which it
    is a part and in so doing increases the peasantry's relative
    centrality or opportunity in the system's communication arena
    and symbolic world. In short, the movement is infectious and
    its energy conversions tend to accelerate geometrically. ...

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >This illustrates 'civil
  amplification', as suggested by John Plott (1966). By civil amplification
  we refer to "a social chain reaction with positive feedback."
  There exists some multiplier 'k' which regulates social cohesion
  or innovation. Where 'k' is negative, there is a tendency toward
  social collapse. At greater than unity, there is a social divergence,
  representing a process or growth. At unity, there is cohesion
  but no growth. This value 'k' may not be a simple one: here it
  denotes 'structural bind'. Structural bind is a function of 'solidarity',
  which is a function of 'capacity' and 'opportunity'.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >k is a positive function
  with respect to C, and a negative function with respect to O.
  Where O and C are proportional, there is social cohesion. If
  these functions can be specified, we have a model for social
  development which avoids social disruption and vernacular displacement.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >In the Tullis case, 'geometrical
  conversion' represents a self-sustaining 'development- from-below'.
  Development in this sense is related to community 'mobilisation',
  whereby "individuals are led to expend an amount, and sometimes
  a large amount, of the resources at their disposal: time, money,
  energy, enthusiasm, in order to attain a goal which they share
  with other units" (Gaijart, 1976; 20). Mobilisation is,
  therefore, a transfer of resources from pursuing self-limited
  ends to pursuing ends in common-- hence, community development.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Assuming a successful
  mobilisation, there is the further danger of social disorganization.
  The replacement organizations must be institutionalized by establishing
  norms and procedures especially for leadership successions and
  strategies for affecting the larger social system. Failing in
  this, the communities fall into a more difficult situation than
  before: dualistic societies, amoral groupism, secret combinations,
  etc.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The cooperative is frequently
  stressed as a form of organization best suited for bottom-up
  strategies. It enables economies of scale in purchasing inputs
  and a better market position in the sale of outputs. It is also
  the most logical step from the household unit. But even this
  organization requries great effort. As Galjart has stressed:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >It must be made clear
    from the start that modern forms of co-operation in the field
    of production cannot be introduced without a radical change of
    values on the part of the independent peasant producer. At the
    level of economic development attained by the communities under
    discussion here, the family is the most important productive
    and consumer unit, in short the most important social unit for
    the peasant. His whole life-style and methods of work are adapted
    to that unit. It is thus not surprising that, with this frame
    of reference, these values, he will tend to reject a production
    structure which does not start from the family as the principal
    social unit, but rather from the local peasant community. ...
    I mention this in order to explain why the co-operatives to which
    these peasants belong are nearly always service co-operatives.
    ... (Galjart, 1976; 55)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The need for a cooperative
  is usually felt at only higher levels of development. Hence,
  in Chile, there were two types of agricultural cooperatives:
  the 'cooperative agricola' established by the larger farmers,
  and usually prosperous; and the 'cooperativa campesina' established
  by the government for small farmers, and usually in a very weak
  economic position.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >As the system again converges
  at some new equilibrium, service cooperatives operatating within
  small groups are recommended. Larger co-options may follow given
  an initial success. Of equal value is the notion of 'project'
  which, being of limited duration, requires only a short-term
  commitment of resources. A successful completion would again
  encourage further organization and longer term commitments. For
  Galjart, however, the service cooperatives are not recommended
  as viable or valuable, having only a marginal economic effect.
  He stresses instead the use of the production cooperatives wherever
  feasible:</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >The only form of co-operative
    which prevents the growth of social and economic inequality in
    agricultural development, and then only within each group, is
    the production co-operative. it will be clear that the inducing
    of such co-operatives must be based upon a political decision
    at the national level. It also implies that the peasants must
    be convinced that this is their only way of achieving a higher
    standard of living. The setting up of a co-operative must therefore
    be preceded or accompanied by a radical indoctrination process.

  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >That the traditional
  elite can solicit support on the national level requires that
  the peasantry, too, have allies on that level. A position of
  bargaining power is usually a prerequisite to insure that mobilization
  from below will have its desired effect after institutionalization.
  A strength in numbers is usually certain, but there is the requirement
  of solidarity among the peripheral groups: sharing common interests
  and symbols. This is made difficult by the locality-identification
  which is common to peasant groups and implied in the territorial
  -- or vernacular -- orientation.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >An illustration of this
  problem is described by Baring-Gould (1974) in the case of the
  Mexican ejidos. The Mexican revolution was not based on such
  a solidarity or class consciousness within the peasant communities,
  but originated between struggling elite groups. One group emerged
  with the industrialisation of Mexico under Diaz and the concentration
  of political power within the industrial and urban sectors. Modero,
  on the other hand, represented the young landed elite who saw
  thier status diminished. The peasants were promised land contingent
  on their support in overthrowing the Diaz regime.</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >... With the termination
    of over conflict in the 1920's, the movement lost much of its
    dynamic force, and as a result of its organizational weaknesses
    reverted to a subordinate position of control within the political
    party of Calles. As a result, similar to the early Revolutionary
    period, the peasant and agrarian movement was reduced to the
    status of a supporter without active or effective participation
    in the process of national decision-making and development. In
    effect this hierarchical and dualized pattern persisted under
    Cardenas, who in spite of turning to the peasant as one of his
    basic supporters in power, presersved the ideology that the greatest
    opportunities for reform existed through the maintenance of loyalty
    to the radical or power elites. The fact that such radical changes
    and solutions to agrarian problems were achieved by the Cardenas
    administration, rather than through the autonomous actions of
    the peasant class themselves, merely served to institutionalize
    this structural relationship of dependence .... (Baring-Gould,
    1974; 73)</FONT></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Baring-Gould further
  establishes the dependency process in the ejido systems. According
  to his measurements, low solidarity and conflict were positively
  related to higher rankings of agricultural and community differentiation,
  as well as to linkages. This would be consistent with the dependency
  hypothesis that social disorganization accompanies economic development.
  Of greater importance to Baring-Gould, however, is the relation
  of technology to social organization: technology appropriate
  to large centralized farms is not appropriate for the ejido system.</FONT></P>

  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Capacity and opportunity
  have been used above with reference to 'linkages', which has
  not been explicitly defined. Linkages are information pathways:
  eg, monetary exchange and barter, printed and broadcasted media,
  data banks, bulletin boards, libraries, etc. Linkages were discussed
  with respect to the bureaucratic triangle as a vertical dendritic
  pattern. For peripheral development, horizontal linkages develop
  solidarity with other localities; vertical linkages integrate
  with functional systems. A communication technique which has
  gained extensive use in peripheral areas is the 'media forum',
  where farmers or other groups would meet regularly to listen
  to a radio braodcast concerning some aspect of development. An
  extension agent with special knowledge of the subject would facilitate
  the group discussion that followed. The broadcast could be timed
  to coincide with local activities to put the process into expression.
  These expressions, however, should be coordinated so that they
  do not represent chaotic episodes, but logically adhere to an
  overall design.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >As an illustration, the
  Indian case may prove helpful. Over a thirty year period of attempting
  to re-institute the village system, a multilevel planning process
  has evolved to help "nest" and "unify" the
  competing interests and activities. The official terminology
  for this process is 'integrative rural development', which implies
  rurual planning while acknowledging small town and urban-rural
  relations. Within the planning stages, the various levels and
  locations will 'transact' or negotiate for the implementation
  of various schemes into the integrated framework. Eventually,
  an integrated 'nest' emerges: the social "coordination is
  located everywhere and nowhere." It was desired that the
  dialogue to the top be representative of the local interests,
  and the Panchayati Rai institutions-- an elected local council--
  were established for this purpose. Unfortunately, there is scarcity
  of talent</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >In view of the unequal
    power relationships between the higher and lower area levels
    in the hierarchy, the latter will have to carry sufficient force,
    depth and conviction in its arguments, to press its demands either
    for increased allocations or for project sanction. This will
    mean that each level must develop its own analytical expertise,
    build up its information system as well as instruments of analysis
    and thus increase its "negotiable strength". (Misra
    and Sundaram, 1980; 26)</FONT></P>

  Second, what is the proper level of centralization to produce
  economies favoring growth versus decentralization to elicit political
  and social participation? We should also remember Forrester's
  boding that these communities "may already be in better

  <P><FONT face=Arial></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >This has been a rather
  sketchy fiction. It is intended to cast light on a process that
  has spread around the globe like a wildfire still burning after
  hundreds of years. That fire began - most likely - in England,
  and has been called variously Enlightenment, Capitalism, Industrialism
  or Development. Development implies instability - a state of
  non-equilibrium - which requires a weakening of traditions and
  cultural institutions - communal and spiritual bonds that have
  provided the reciprocal obligations of life for people in and
  between regions for thousands of years. It demands rationality
  - in thought and action - and particularly production for exchange
  with unknown and far away markets, independent from and regardless
  of one's communal allegiance and basic needs.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Such instability as played
  out as the <I>terreur</I> in France two hundred years ago, now
  shows itself in Eastern Europe - held together for a time by
  Soviet domination - now thrown naked into a world beyond its
  control. In Africa, too, ethnic strife - heightened by colonial
  administrative policies raising one group as fiduciaries over
  its neighboring groups - has brought a terror unimagined even
  at the time of Bastille.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Most of us grapple with
  it from a distance - headlines in a paper, rapid announcements
  on the radio. We think it is an inevitable price to betterment.
  We gasp a little, maybe we want to smack others around, perhaps
  withhold economic aid. Most directly affected do not understand
  it, either. Political factions try to form a coalition for order;
  religious and ethnic groups battle each other over a dwindling
  residue of control; many blame foreign nationals - like the Great
  Satan in Washington, DC. They are proud and they are angry, but
  they do not know how, who, - or what - to fight.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >Rationalism is a cold
  machine without a human spirit. Yet our mystics who should be
  driving it, merely fight among themselves. No wonder our <I>rational realists</I> wish to rid the world of them, as mere superstition
  or <I>Neo-Cheaters</I>. But development must issue from some
  source - an intention, an "intrinsic reaping of value."
  If we do not - as humanity - steer the machine, we are apt to
  be run over by it.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"  >We each of us - anyone
  who carries even a nickle, peso or rupiah - own a piece of this
  vast machine. It is by our collective - organismic - aspiration
  and effort, that this machine is allowed to consume and produce.
  For every nickle spent, we help to steer it. Every peso creates
  one more quantum of work-energy. Every rupiah is a claim to its
  future output. This is a responsibility that few have accepted
  or even appreciated. But whether you like it or not, whether
  your use it or not, the machine will continue to consume and
