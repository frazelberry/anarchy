   FACE="Comic Sans MS">, we can categorize our identification,
  or scope, in three categories. In the first category, we have
  no scope whatsoever. Shortly after our birth as human beings,
  we were completely depedent upon our mother or someone very much
  like her. It was all we could do to shrivel our tiny fingers
  and toes, and blast out our lungs tearfully, our face turning
  red and not at all very attractive, whenever anything displeased
  us or our bodies needed nourishment, etc. We didn't think too
  much about either oneself or the other in this situation. It
  was just &quot;need&quot; or &quot;displeasure&quot;. There probably
  was - even then - a stirring of the mental habit - discursive
  thought - but it was, no doubt, a vague babble, nothing we would
  want to call &quot;me&quot;.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">In the second stage, we begin to
  identify with certain aspects of our &quot;reality&quot;. We
  began to experiment with our little fingers and toes, wiggling
  them around in space. We start to categorize things - what is
  me and what is mine; and what is something foreign. Then, in
  association with family members and school children, we began
  to &quot;find our place.&quot; We don't have to think too much
  about it; we allow others to define who we are. Some children
  were &quot;cool&quot;, some &quot;not so cool,&quot; and then,
  in my school, we had categories like &quot;nigger,&quot; &quot;queer,&quot;
  and &quot;nerds&quot;. I think modern lingo has expanded these
  into sub-categories like &quot;dweeb&quot; and &quot;dork&quot;
  and others I do not understand. And, being social beings, we
  took such names to indicate our true &quot;self&quot;.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">After this, we take on occupations
  and religions, neighborhoods and familial obligations. The content
  of one's &quot;self&quot; changes like a mix of various fluids,
  and we fuss and pose in various manners to convey to ourselves
  and those around us which fluids those are, changing them as
  conditions warrant. But it doesn't phase us how fluid this self
  <I>really</I> is. Most of us kind of settle into a mix that seems
  comfortable, that works for us in our situation at the time.
  And we may pass through life with some comfort and security this
  way, never really questioning what or who this self <I>really
  </I>is. Nonetheless, we are willing to kill and even die for
  it.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">And so the third category of this
  process at which, by the way, few of us ever arrive, is the questioning
  and, finally, the very dissolution of self. This is so remote
  from our usual experience, that we call it <I>religious</I> -
  something for gods or buddhas or some other being much greater
  than my own meager mind. And there is some reason for this; because
  the qualities of such a realization is the very essence of virtue.
  What are these qualities? Compassion, love, generosity, patience,
  things like this - which most of us can only approximate in our
  better moments. These things only become possible once the illusion
  of self has dissolved to some extent. And this process begins
  only when we admit that what we think is not necessarily the
  way things are; and that what we identify with is not necessarily
  <I>who</I> we are.</FONT></P>
