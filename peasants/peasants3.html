<P><U><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">THE EXTENDED ANALYSIS</FONT></U></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The empirical economy
is embedded and enmeshed in social relations not liquid capital.
The family is the unit of production-- not an abstract firm operating
for economic motive alone. Economic ties are personalized, labor
is given as a social service or activity and, in many communities,
the request for labor is a delicate social maneuver. Production
is not maximized in accordance with market prices (although the
dual functioning of the peasant would not exlude this possiblity),
but often in conjunction with ceremonial seasons-- when a cash
outlay is required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The marketing structure
of peasant communities are exemplified by Nash (1966) in the case
of Latin America to be of three categories: the regional marketing
system; the adjunct export economy; and the quasi-tribal system.
The first pertains to the independent rotating marketplaces, which
in their most developed forms are described as solar markets.
Around the major market center are market places in other communities
which tend to specialize in a given product and function as markets
only on specially determined days. The regional market system
remains &quot;...money organized in single households as both
consumption and production units with a strongly developed market
which tends to be perfectly competitive&quot; (Tax, 1953).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The adjunct export economy
consists of those commodities which are produced specifically
for cash exchange. These markets tend to be directed by non-peasants.
The quasi-tribal system are designed to meet locally defined demands.
Money is not absent from any of these markets, yet neither is
it dominant. Values are influenced by the external market, but
there remain social pressures on the participants to value their
transactions on the basis of relative wealth between bargaining
positions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">A general 'bargaining
curve' is shown above. Each curve represents the value placed
on two commodities by on participant in the bargaining process.
Each person has different levels of the two commodities (or at
least assigns different values to them). <I>B</I> has more commodity
value of one item relative to another, and therefore may be willing
to forego some of the former for an increase in the latter. To
the extent that the opposite situation holds with <I>A</I> a trade
is possible. The actual result of the trade will occur somewhere
between the two curves, yet remains ambiguous. Part of the result
will be due to relative bargaining skills between the participants,
yet there is ample room for subtle social factors to influence
the final result.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For Polanyi, the market
principles of pre-commercial society consisted of reciprocity
and redistribution. These principles are aided by social-political
factors such as symmetry and centricity. Centricity is operated
by a chieftan or lord who &quot;provides a track for the collection,
storage and redistribution of goods and services&quot;. The symmetry
is defined in terms of subdivisions which lead to &quot;pairing
out of individual relations and thereby assist the give-and-take
of goods and services....&quot; Further as long as social organization
runs in its ruts, no individual economic motives need come into
play.... The economic system is, in effect, a mere function of
social organization&quot; (Polanyi, 1944)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Important in peasant economic
organization is the function of gifts. The gift giving is implicit
within the reciprocity function of pre-commercial economies. There
is a subtle, yet important, social distinction here. The concept
of 'mine' is obviously different for the Siane tribesman than
the suburban homeowner. Each contains an element of projected
ego. For the tribesman, 'mine' has meaning only within the context.of
social relation between the speaker and listener. The term may
be applied, therefore, to an item which actually belongs to his
community, if the speaker is addressing a visitor from outside
of that community. The distinction 'mine' in either case necessarily
implies a demand. In the case of gift-giving there is a subtle
message that the gift should be returned in equal value at some
point in time - hence the gift is exchanged for an obligation.
This obligation, however, is tempered also by the relative wealth
between the participants of the exchange-- hence, 'of equal value'
remains a subjective and social derivative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">As long as the economic
system is a mere function of social organization there will remain
an imperative to restrict the operation of that economy within
the bounds which are conducive to a continuation of that society's
norms and values. To maintain a stable social organization, the
extremes of wealth and poverty must be diminished-- hence the
common use of 'leveling mechanisms'. In Amatanego, those mechanisms
include the use of mythical figures (Don Klabil), liquor as a
medium of exchange (discussed previously) and civil and religious
duties (the alferez). Not only is wealth leveled from above, however,
but poverty is likewise diminished through the mechanisms of redistribution
and the ambiguity described in barter and gift exchange. To Polanyi,
it is &quot;the absence of the threat of individual starvation
which makes primitive society, in a sense, more human than the
market economy, and at the same time, less economic&quot; (Polanyi,
1944). This is evident in the formalist analysis, but as regards
the temporal stability of the peasant social-economic system,
the empirical economy has obviously operated with amiable success.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">With the advent of the
market economy all this must be changed. The social and economic
systems, indistinguishable through the ages, now must recognize
laws which <U>are strictly</U> economic in character. Polanyi
resurrects Aristotle as having recognized the basic truth long
ago:</FONT></P>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Aristotle insists on
  production for use as against production for gain as the essense
  of householding proper.... (Gain) was a motive peculiar to production
  for the market, and that the money factor introduced a new element
  into the situation, yet nevertheless, as long as markets and
  money were mere accessories to an otherwise self-sufficient household,
  the principle of production for use could operate.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">.... In denouncing the
  principle of production for gain &quot;as not natural to man&quot;,
  as boundless and limitless, Aristotle was in effect, aiming at
  the crucial point, namely the divorcedness of a separate economic
  motive from the social relations in which these limitations inhered.
  (Ibid)</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Also for Marx:</FONT></P>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The first step by which
  a useful object is enabled to become an exchange-value is that
  it should have an existence as something which has not a use-value
  for its owner; and this happens when it forms a superfluous portion
  of some article that satisfies his immediate wants. Objects in
  and by themselves exists apart from man, and are therefore alienable
  by him. If this alienation of objects is to be reciprocal, all
  that is requisite is that human beings shall tacitly confront
  one another as the individual owners of such alienable objects,
  and shall thus confront one another as mutually independent persons.
  But no such relation of mutual independence exists for the members
  of a primitive community.... Commodity exchange begins where
  community life ends; begins at the point of contact between a
  community and an alien community, or between the members of two
  different communities. But as soon as products have become commodities
  in the external relations of a community, they also become, by
  repercussion, commodities in the internal,life of the community
  (Marx, 1930).</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In historical placement,
external and local trade, as discussed by Polanyi, are determined
by geographical distance and specialisation of production. As
such it exists primarily as complementary in relation. &quot;Only
with the emergence of internal or national trade does competition
tend to be accepted as a general principle of trading&quot;. Economic
development through market relations makes its emergence proper
with the emergence of the nation-state, or national economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For Europe, the newly
emerging order was fettered by the world view which aided the
feudal system for hundreds of years. The Catholic Church had saturated
Europe throughout the Middle Ages and had done so primarily because
its emphasis aptly suited the economic conditions of the time.
&quot;Land had been given by God to men in order to enable them
to live here below with a view to their eternal salvation. The
object of labor was not to grow wealthy but to maintain oneself
in the position in which one was born, until mortal life should
pass into life eternal. The monk's renunciation was the ideal
on which society shoull fix its gaze&quot; (Pirenne in Dalton,
1966). So successful had this world view been for such a long
time, that it took centuries of social disruption to introduce
the principles of economic revival: commercial profits, capital
and loans at interest. The Church itself, as late as the nineteenth
century, had assisted the masses in escaping the forces of institutionalized
wage-labor. Weber, here, emphasizes the success of the Protestant
ethic in providing a new religious springboard into the new order.
Even so, when the capitalist system becomes fully operational,
Protestantism is no longer needed. The world view of 'economic
rationality' becomes sufficient to maintain the operation-- society
is secularised.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For the newly emerging
nation-states, or economies, <U>nationalism</U> becomes the springboard
justifying the economic development activities. National strength
becomes the overriding objective, and industrialisation the method.
The particular political banner is of no consequence. The Sandanistas
of Nicaragua offer the latest example of this. The road for economic
development lies through the disruption of the Miskito Indian
villages which had been autonomous for hundreds of years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">As noted previously, it
is the introduction of industrialisation (the elaborate machine)
which induced the 'instrumentality of things' defined by Marx
as the crystallization of capitalism. It involves the introduction
of science into all branches of production. In modern industrial
society &quot;an individual has normally a high degree of anonymity,
of impersonality in the economic situation.... It is the magnitude
and quality of his contribution to the economic process, irrespective
of his personal status or position in the society , that defines
him&quot; (Frankenberg in Firth, 1967). Where society once structured
its economy to suit its social ends, now human beings which had
comprised that society and land which had formed the social base,
now become subsumed within the economic order as commodities to
be bought and sold within the commercial processes. For Polanyi:</FONT></P>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In disposing of a man's
  labor power the system would, incidentally dispose of the physical,
  psychological, and moral entity ... Robbed of the protective
  covering of cultural institutions, human beings would perish
  from the effects of social exposure; they would die as the victims
  of acute social dislocation through vice, perversion, crime,
  and starvation. Nature would be reduced to its elements, neighborhoods
  and landscapes defiled, rivers polluted, military safety jeopardized,
  the power to produce food and raw materials destroyed. Finally,
  the market administration of purchasing power would periodically
  liquidate business enterprise, for shortages and surfeits of
  money would prove as disastrous to business as floods and droughts
  in primitive society. (Polanyi, 1944)</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Polanyi then follows the
intellectual debate which ran in England through the uncertain
beginnings of capitalism. The classical works of Hume, Smith and
Ricardo offered rationalizations, if not rationality, to the new
social order. It has been argued that the classical theories are
more apologetic than definitive: &quot;the 'subsistence' or 'iron
law' theory of wages was based on demographic assumptions for
which there was not a scrap of evidence; but, as a theory it suited,
or seemed to suit, a policy of low wages and high profits&quot;
(Cohen in Firth, 1967)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Polanyi emphasizes that
it was not the technical, but the social sciences which gave impetus
to the peculiar economic organization known as capitalism. It
became substantiated in the naturalistic and utilitarian doctrines
of the nineteenth century. To the naturalists, &quot;Poverty was
nature surviving in society, its physical sanction was hunger&quot;.</FONT></P>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Hobbes had argued the
  need for a despot because men were like beasts; Townsend insisted
  that they were actually beasts and that, precisely for that reason,
  only a minimum of government was required.... a free society
  could be regarded as consisting of two races: property owners
  and laborers .... No magistrates were necessary, for hunger was
  a better disciplinarian than the magistrate.(Polanyi, 1944)</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Bentham, the early utilitarian,
went further in justifying the system to be denoted &quot;Laissez-faire&quot;
(which merely indicated the seperation of economic and social
realms): &quot;In the highest stage of social prosperity...the
great mass of the citizens will most probably possess few other
resources than their daily labor, and consequently will always
be near to indigence... (therefore) the task of the government
was to increase want in order to make the physical sanction of
hunger effective&quot; (Bentham quoted in Polanyi)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">These points may seem
overstressed in a study of peasant economies. But precisely because
the social institutions remain the sole distinctions of the empirical
economy, the dynamics of those institutions assume a major importance
with the introduction of development policies which now form the
dominating superstructure of most peasant economies. It is due
to these stresses that the continuation of that economy is now
the matter of much speculation and doubt. And it is to this interrelationship
that we now turn.</FONT></P>
