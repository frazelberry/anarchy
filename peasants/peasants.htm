<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Societies are often studied
in terms of structural relations with no consideration to their
economic quality. Yet, structural relations - i.e., norms - are
often derived from economic factors. The family, for example,
is not found as such in the primitive Siane culture (Salisbury,
1962; Nash, 1966), but arises from, among other considerations,
the division of labor based on sex. By identifying 'economy' as
a subsystem of social relations through which a society patterns
the flow of life support, it becomes evident that &quot;many fundamental
changes in the structure of society originate in the economic
sphere, and that the continuity of a social system is intimately
related to a given level of performance of the economy&quot; (Nash,
1966)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">On the other hand, in
isolating economic relations in an attempt to produce a purely
physical - <I>vs</I> social or political - science, modern economics
has transformed our relations into commodities to be bought, sold
and discarded. It has very nearly succeeded in abstracting humanity
out of our own endeavors. Thus, in employing economic analysis
to a social system, certain clarifications are in order at the
outset. These clarifications have been offered in the field of
economic-anthropology by its own self-questioning dialogue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Polanyi and Weber offer
the fundamental distinction between 'substantive' and 'formal'
economies. 'Formal' analysis is the domain of academia and policy-makers,
which emphasises a definite situation of choice, i.e. in a field
of scarcity. Within the formal relation (which must include the
economist himself) are such concepts as 'economical' and 'economizing'.
Each represents the &quot;logical character of the means-ends
relationship&quot;(Polanyi, 1957). 'Economizing' implies a maximization
of some end and/or a minimization of the means to an end. 'Economic'
implies some special set of rules designed to achieve an economizing
solution. The hazard of the formalistic method lies in that the
abstraction posits means for ends and the subtle ultimate ends
are exluded from the model. Where the formalists have gained the
most liberated position we find national policies pursuing such
economic goals as efficiency and productivity over the ultimate
social concerns as health and welfare.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">As a contrast to the formalist
discipline, Polanyi also defines the 'substantive' meaning of
economic, which implies neither choice nor insufficiency of means.
The substantive model is more indicative of the subsistence than
the exchange economies, although the distinction between economies
may be more limiting than necessary. To quote directly:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <DIR>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The fount of the substantive
    concept is the empirical economy. It can be briefly (if not engagingly)
    defined as an instituted process of interaction between man and
    his environment, which results in a continuous supply of want
    satisfying material means.</FONT>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The instituting of an
    economic process vests that process with unity and stability....
    The human economy, then, is embedded and enmeshed in institutions,
    economic and noneconomic. The inclusion of the noneconomic is
    vital. For religion and government may be as important for the
    structuring of the economy as monetary institutions or the availability
    of tools and machines themselves .... (Polanyi, 1957)</FONT>
  </DIR>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">One cannot dismiss social
and cultural factors from the modern economies which lie under
the scalpel of the formal economist, neither can on neglect the
processes of economizing in the archaic. To say that primitive
and peasant economies do not operate in a field of scarcity is
to miss the obvious. Even within the most suitable climate and
soil conditions, the agrarian community must nevertheless allocate
resources and choose activities on the restriction of its most
elemental and limited resource: <B>time</B>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Economists may therefore
chart a hierarchy of values, construe opportunity costs, substitutability
of commodities and tangencies of indifference schedules and commodity
costs (expressed as labour-time). Thus, to the extent that economizing
processes do occur, the economic analysis of formal inquiry (or
some modification of it) may be applied. The delicate task of
economic-anthropology is to delineate that extent. The restriction
of markets and the absense of a fully exchangable commodity (money)
certainly limit the rigor of analysis and condition the results,
but do not preclude the operation of economic rationality.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The principle of economic
rationality rests on three assumptions which become the axioms
of formalist inquiry: 1) the law of diminishing marginal utility--
i.e. the feeling of satisfaction from a particular commodity gets
smaller as the amount of that commodity increases; 2) the law
of diminishing returns, i.e. as equal increments of a variable
input are added into the production process-- holding all other
inputs constant-- beyond a certain point the resulting rate of
increase in product will decrease; 3) that given enough information,
persons will act in accordance with the first two laws in such
a way as to maximize their gains or minimize their losses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Granted, the models to
be introduced must be taken as suggestive rather than definitive
due to the embedded and enmeshed institutions in which the economic
actor forms his utilities and disutilities, yet even these may
be approximated within the models of analysis within the utility
schedules themselves. Even in the context of social relations,
economic factors expose themselves:</FONT></P>

  <DIR>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">It would appear that
    in primitive economic systems the mobilizer of cooperative effort
    for enterprises such as housebuilding or team agriculture is
    more concerned to ensure a large labour supply for social reasons
    than to eliminate marginal workers. But even here, assuming some
    degree of continuity and certainty in operations, the mobilizer
    may be concerned with the marginality of social factors. Moreover,
    granted the heavy institutional pressure on those who invite
    labour contributions to welcome all comers and reward them equally,
    concepts of the marginality of technical factors still do not
    seem to be absent from the host's economic calculations. If the
    job is a relatively small one invitations are sent out to a relatively
    limited circle of people. The host does calculate, if only in
    rough terms, how much food or beer he has on hand or can mobilize
    in relation to the amount of labour force he requires and can
    entertain. (Firth, 1967)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For a running definition
of peasant economies, we may contrast it with the modern. Tasks
are generally not highly differentiated in the peasant economy;
the productive organization is derived from other social relations
(generally, the family); there is limited cost accounting, money
exchange and market interaction. The corollary of the latter is
that the peasant production Organisation is predominantly structured
for subsistence-- meaning simultaneously, the production of the
bare minimum necessary to subsist, and that production and consumption
are more or less direct. A further specification of subsistence
production is that the means of production are decentralized,
local and familial, that: l) relations of coercion, exploitation...are
not created in the system of production, and 2) that in the absence
of exchange there is a tendency to limit production to what can
be used&quot; (Frankenberg in Firth) These distinctions will re-appear
in our micro-analysis of the family farm.</FONT></P>
