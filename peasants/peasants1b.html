<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In the commercial firm</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">, factors of production (nature,
labor and capital) are combined in such a way as to equate each's
marginal cost (rent, wage, and interest, respectively) to its
marginal product. This is portrayed graphically below. Here we
show the total, marginal and average productivity of one variable
factor input holding all others constant. After the point leveled
'<I>A</I>', we see the marginal product decline. This is the second
assumption of economic rationality discussed above. The firm will
produce between <I>B</I> and <I>C</I>, specifically where the
value of the marginal product (marginal physical product times
the price of the output) equals the marginal factor cost. The
profit yielded the to the firm will be the difference between
the value of the average product less the value of the marginal
product less the total of all other factor costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The choice between different
combinations of inputs for the commercial firm is portrayed to
the above right in two dimensional variable input space. The firm
will be capital intensive or labor intensive (or we could use
land extensive vs intensive) according to relative factor costs.
The curve denoted <I>Q</I> represents a given level of output
for varying combinations of two variable inputs. The slope of
the curve represents the degree of substitutability between the
two factors. At some point one cannot substitute for the other,
and the curve <I>Q</I> becomes perfectly vertical or horizontal.
<I>Q</I> is subscripted <I>1,2,3</I> according to the level of
output, with <I>Q3</I> greater than <I>Q2 </I>greater than <I>Q1</I>.
The<I> tt'</I> line represents all possible combinations of expenditures
between capital and labor inputs, with <I>TC/r</I> representing
the total amount of capital availableait consumed the total budget
(<I>TC</I> = Total Cost, <I>r</I> = the rental rate on capital),
and <I>TC/w</I> representing the same respectively for labor (<I>w</I>
= the wage rate). The optimum choice of input combinations is
at <I>E</I> producing output level<I> Qe</I> and consuming <I>Ke</I>
capital and <I>Le</I> labor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Without marginal costs
and revenue to determine the peasant solutions, however, the peasant
farm often increases its outlays of labor and capital far above
the optimum rate as determined by rate of return on factors of
production. The peasant, instead, operates in terms of total output,
as opposed to marginal. We see in the graph above for one variable
input, total output is maximized where marginal product equals
zero. If we equate the value of the marginal product to wage--
as we would in the commercial firm-- it is obvious that the peasant
would receive no wage at all in maximizing total output. The choice
between factor inputs is not determined so much by relative factor
prices (although it is influenced in the sense of opportunity
costs), but again by the size of the family farm-- ie. the amount
of labor on hand, regardless of the amount of land and capital
available to it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">When approaching the organization
of an undertaking based on the principles of the family labor
farm, we first of all find that one of its elements-- the labor
force-- is fixed by being present in the composition of the family.</FONT></P>

  <DIR>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">... Given freedom to
    acquire the necessary area of land for use and the possibility
    of having available the necessary means of production, peasant
    farms are structured to conform to the optimal degree of self-exploitation
    of the family labor force and in a technically optimal system
    of production factors as regards their size and relationship
    of the parts. Any excess of production means available of labor
    or of land above the technically optimal level will be an excessive
    burden on the undertaking. It will not lead to an increased volume
    of activity, since further intensity of labor beyond the level
    established for its self-exploitation is unacceptable to the
    family. Its productivity due to an increase in capital intensity
    naturally cannot be raised once the achieved rate of provision
    is itself optimal. (Chayanov)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The peasant's demand for
capital is limited by the size of his personal budget. In Chayanov's
estimation &quot;...while the farm's capital intensity has not
yet reached its optimum, the growth rate for capital renewal in
most cases exceeds that for personal budgets ... (We) may suppose
that determining the expenditures on capital renewal is inseparably
linked with that of personal budgets ... these expenditures are
included in our system of the basic economic equilibrium between
drudgery of labor and the farm family's demand satisfaction&quot;
(Ibid) Hence, it can be represented in the same manner as introduced
earlier. Below we show two possible effects of capital investment.
In the first, the capital increased the level of productivity,
both increasing the level of output and decreasing the degree
of drudgery. In the second, the growth in labor productivity was
so insignificant that it could not cover the deduction from the
family's budget. To the extent that land and labor are substitutes,
the same illustration can be drawn on an increase of land area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Beckford (1974) offers
a clarification of the concept of 'risk' as it pertains to the
peasant farm based on an analysis by Miracle. He defines the minimum
physiologic level of consumption (MPL) which is fixed by nature,
and the minimum desirable level of consumption(MDL) which is culturally
determined. The capacity to take risks with investment or new
technologies increases as one approaches or exceeds one's MDL,
whereas one will minimize i,sks as one approaches one's MPL. In
the graphs below, B in both instances would be more likely to
take risks, with greater probability in the second case.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For the peasant, the decision
to take risks is a critical one because &quot;the context of economic
choice is a multi-purposed social organization, which, unlike
a firm, cannot liquidate if it makes poor calculations....&quot;(Nash
in Dalton, 19,67). This forms a defining characteristic for Nash--
discussing the peoples of Meso-America:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <DIR>
    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The people and societies
    do not lack economic rationality, the matching of means and ends
    for best outputs; they do not hedge economic activity with a
    host of traditional barriers; they do not despise wealth and
    hard work; and the economies exhibit the free market where each
    man follows his own economic interest ... What is lacking is
    the social organization of an entity like the firm, an autonomous,
    corporate group dedicated to and organized for economic activity.
    (Nash, 1966)</FONT>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The capacity to form capital
is also limited by the impositions on the personal budget by the
social processes of the community. The social 'leveling mechanisms'
are common to peasant communities. Nash offers an illustration
of the use of liquor as a medium of exchange among the Amatenango
in Meso-America. Many exchanges are paid in liquor which is consumed
at the point of exchange-- thus negating accumulation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Nevertheless, the peasant
community is not entirely homogeneous. Land is typically distributed
(at least nominally) on the basis of family size. The larger families
are often able to exploit economies of scale, enhancing the marginal
productivity of labor (becoming land extensive rather than intensive).
An example of this would be in due to the amount of time spent
in hitching up the plow, the labor-time spent plowing an additional
field would not be nearly as great as the first. Also the use
of more land might allow for natural.fallowing as opposed to labor-intensive
soil preparation. Graphically, returning to our previous graph
of the one variable input case, say the variable input is labor,
an increase in any other input would shift the total product of
labor curve to the left, requiring less of the variable input
per unit produce. This would explain how some land holders evolve
into an overseer function, since by employing other labor that
labor<B> </B>is able to produce subsistence needs for both itself
and the landlord.</FONT></P>
