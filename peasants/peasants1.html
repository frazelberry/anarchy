<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Our initial graphical
analysis portrays two commodities ( for simplicity), meat along
the horizontal axis and vegetables along the verticle. In the
case of the pure subsistence producer/consumer, we may posit an
indifference schedule, <I>IC</I>, by revealed preference, representing
all the various combinations of meat and vegetables with which
the consumer is indifferent (i.e. derives the same level of utility).
The shape of each indifference curve shows the assumption of diminishing
marginal utility-- the slope at any point along the curve is the
ratio between each commodity's marginal utility. As we approach
either extreme, more of one commodity held in abundance will be
forgone to attain the scarce commodity. The <I>IC</I> curves are
numbered 1,2,3 in relation to level of utility-- utility is increased
as we move up and to the right. We also draw a production frontier,<I>
PD</I>, which shows the maximum level of meat and vegetables combinations
attainable to the producer. The slope of the <I>PD</I> curve is
the ratio of the marginal cost of each commodity. Cost may be
expressed here in labor units expended. Hence, as we move down
and to the left along the <I>PD</I> curve, less labor is expended
in the production of vegetables, more in meat. The point of tangency
between the <I>PD</I> and <I>IC</I> curves represents the optimum
solution: where the ratio between marginal utilities equals the
ratio of marginal costs. This point of tangency represents the
highest indifference curve attainable-- hence the highest level
of utility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">In the peasant case we
would include a complex matrix of social and economic variables
into the decision process. We would expect the utility curve to
be drawn in such a way as to maximize family welfare. We would
also expect that most factors of producti<IMG SRC="peasf02.JPG"
WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="197" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2">on
are not defined by costs, yet the goods produced may have a priced
assigned to them in limited markets. Hence, we draw into our subsistence
model additional lines representing ratios of market prices which
may alter our subsistence solution. The decrease in the utility
dimension for the two commodities (meat and vegetables) would
be supplemented by the utility gained in the monetary compensation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">These variations in the
result have been confirmed by Chayanov: &quot;Apart from the technical
conditions of production, raising labor productivity on the peasant
farm and the resulting consequences such as raising the consumption
level and the ability to form capital, depend on one general economic
category alone-- market prices&quot; (Chayanov, 1966). The peasant
family is therefore distinct in its economic activity in t<IMG

NATURALSIZEFLAG="2">hat it operates for both subsistence and exchange.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Unlike the commercial
firm which operates solely on the basis of market prices, the
level of economic activity on the peasant farm is not determined
by output prices and factor costs, but rather &quot;by family
size and the equilibrium achieved between its demand satisfaction
and the drudgery of labor&quot; (Ibid). The typical production
firm's supply curve is shown at right. The horizontal price line
assumes a competitive situation in which the price remains constant
at all levels of output, <I>q</I>. The price of the output is
given by the totality of the market: where the capacity to produce
equals the capacity to consume. The firm will produce at the level
of <I>q</I> which maximizes profit-- where marginal cost intersects
(is equal to) marginal revenue (i.e., price)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">For the peasant family,
costs and income are not so definite. Much of<IMG SRC="peasf04.JPG"

the product is consumed directly, and the labor input, at least,
is free (as defined by opportunity costs, which are often negligible).
The peasant will produce to the point where his marginal utility
of income (the value he places on the next additional level of
produce) equals his marginal disutility of labor (the dis-value
he places on his next additional level of effort). This schema
was also introduced by Chayanov. In the graph to the right, <I>MU</I>
represents marginal utility, <I>MD</I>, marginal disutility of
labor, <I>q*</I> , the resultant <!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->quantity
produced, and <I>V*,</I> the derived subjective value level of
<I>q*.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The level of output shown
above corresponds to the subsistence graph presented earlier.
The difference is from comparing composite commodities above as
opposed to a comparison between two commodities earlier. In either
case, marginal value is equated with marginal costs. The Chayanov
model introduces a,subjective factor.into marginal costs, however.
Here, the costs are represented in terms of disutility, rather
than in labor-time. The assumption in the previous model was that
labor had the same disutility between two uses, and the choice
was derived between which use to direct it.</FONT></P>
