<P><B><U><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">THE MACRO-ANALYSIS</FONT></U></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">It would be inappropriate
to leave our analysis at the micro-level (that of the family farm)
because in the same manner that the peasant society is a part-society
(interrelated to a larger social structure), so the peasant economy
is a part-economy. The Russian Mir itself - that which formed
the basis of Chayanov's analysis - is suggested by Weber, among
others, to be &quot;not a primitive institution but a product
of the taxation system and of serfdom&quot; (Weber, 1927). For
Weber, the ideal peasant village was in Germany, and in Russia
by contrast, serfdom was &quot;unusually harsh&quot;. The peasant
was subject to torture; bound not only to the soil but also to
the village. As Chayanov suggests, land was distributed according
to family size, but Weber argues that such decisions were only
nominally democratic and more ofte<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->n
&quot;capitalistically determined&quot;. The peasant simultaneously
owed obligations to the lord and church in labor and kind, taxes
to the village and was under the domination of 'lulaks' through
money lending.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The feudal economy is
often described in terms of bilaterality-there are two interlocking
economies: the landlord economy (principally the demesne as the
predominant agricultural enterprise); and the peasant household
economy discussed above. The differentiation of wealth which lies
at the base of feudalism is attributed by Weber to be of different
sources, among which are chieftmanship, the internal differentiation
through the appearance of a professional military class, and the
conquest and subjugation of some enemy people. Tradition maintained
the status of the lord and protected the peasant from excessive
exploitation. The peasant did not produce any more than was necessary
to maintain his own subsistence and meet the obligations imposed.
The lord had no interest in increasing the size of those obligations
as long as he <B>did not produce for a market. </B>Following the
demise of the Roman Empire, markets in Europe were at best sporadic
and limited-- the feudal system remained relatively stable for
hundreds of years. This stability was reinforced for some time
in the self-interests of the nobles, as well. The nobility of
Europe were usually exempt from taxation, that burden being passed
on to the peasant. It was in the interest of the nobility therefore
to maintain peasant landholdings to ensure this exemption.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The character of the feudal
economy was not essentially different from the peasant household,
however. The similarity was not due so much to the absense of
a freely exchangeable currency, requiring payments in kind,, as
to the fact that forced labor-power on the demesne had no price--
'...the feudal economy merely transposed into its own logic the
patriarchal small I peasant conception of 'value'....&quot;(Benaji,
1976). Further, when the feudal estate did convert into exchange-value
the use-values produced, it did so not on the basis of some concept
of Sprofit' for accumulation, but solely to consume that for which
it traded. The production of commodities remains &quot;a mediation
of socially-determined levels of consumption&quot;(Ibid); i.e.
it remains subordinated to social habits of generosity, conspicuous
display and a culturally determined standard of living. Direct
consumption remained the sole growth determinate for the economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The manorial accounting
system reflects this absorption of 'consumption value'. Items
of consumption and production were entered into a single ledger.
By the eighteenth century, the 'maximization of sales' became
a central slogan in Russian estates and the primary motivation
was to maximize profits and expand feudal-incomes. We still do
not find a concept of competition between estates, however, and
the goal of maximization was subordinated to a certain &quot;proportionality
between income and consumption&quot; not the rapid expansion of
incomes from one year to the next (the rate of profit) as occurs
within the modern enterprise concerned solely with production.
Because the costs of the feudal estate were its own consumption,
'profit' signified for it only.the maximization of.sales, not
the minimization of costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The process of maximizing
sales brought the peasant more closely under the domination of
the lord. To increase production in the demesne meant expansion
of the surface in production which required that more peasant-labor
had to be extracted from the household economy. In the prior instance,
the household was left with substantial autonomy as to economic
decisions, in the latter form the peasant households were directed
toward simple reproduction on mere subsistence plots which &quot;effectively
eliminated the peasant household as a seperate economic enterprise&quot;(Ibid)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">As the landlords &quot;attempted
to extend compulsory services to which slaves alone were subject&quot;
(Weber) they also placed the peasantry on a fixed money rental
(obrok) in preference to fluctuating payments in kind. &quot;The
growth of the money economy resulted in throwing the peasants
heavily into debt. Only a single crop failure was necessary for
this result, and the freedom of the movement of the peasant was
lost .... The peasant had not more rights than a Roman slave&quot;(Ibid).
The exploitation was extensive, also, to the extent that the overlords
furnished almost nothing in the production process-- the land
was tilled with the capital and horses of the peasants themselves.
The forced savings on the part of the peasantry-- in the form
of rents and taxation-- was not re-invested in capital accumulation,
but was squandered in the culturally determined consumption patterns
of the lords.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Ultimately, the manorial
system did not survive. The accounting system of themanor had
only two columns: receipts and expenditures. Expenditure, as we
have seen, contained both expenses for consumption and production(of
which the latter was negligible), the receipt column included
both receipts from sale and from the excessive borrowing required
to maintain consumption standards. Hence, the financial position
of the.estate was often misstated. The end result was that the
manor was extremely uneconomic. Its disintegration fell in the
hands of the nobility, which destroyed the rural organization
through a process called 'enclosures' and turned the system into
an exchange economy: rents and wages would now be expressed monetarily
and entered into the production functions as factor costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The peasant farm was incorporated
into the new economic system which emerged. Chayanov describes
the 'trading machine' which begins at the traditional bazaar and
constructs &quot;a certain national economic whole .... with its
hundreds of thousands of branches (which extends) to the full
depths of the peasant farms and leaving them free as regards production,
entirely dominates them economically&quot;. Through the process
of financing, transportation, and mortgage credit, &quot;capitalism
penetrates agriculture ... (and) converts the farmers into a labor
force working with other people's means of production&quot; (Chayanov)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">While Chayanov and his
related group of Populist economists sought to describe a path
of development which would enable the peasant economy to integrate
outside of capitalistic domination through vertical cooperation,
Lenin argued that peasant production was <U>already</U> capitalist.
For Lenin, the distinction begins with the social division of
labor which arises intrinsically in commodity production (as opposed
to subsistence production). &quot;Capitalism is a social relation
of production, commodity production based on wage labor. The capitalist
system of production subordinates other forms of possession and
other labor processes by integrating them into its process of
exchange, and, through circulation, imposes on them the logic
of its process of production&quot; (Ennew, et al, 1977). Marx
fully extracted this quality in specifying a freal' capitalist
mode of production:&quot;...by real he meant mature, crystallized,
and the basic sign of this maturity was the formal subsumption
of labor into capital, in other words, a process of labor determined
by capital itself&quot; (Benaji, 1976). Or put differently, &quot;capital
is not a thing but a social relation between persons, established
by the instrumentality of things&quot; (Marx, 1930).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This &quot;instrumentality
of things&quot; encompassed the peasantry by the introduction
of what Polanyi defines as 'fictive commodities'. These are land,
labor and money. Polanyi dates this introduction with the birth
of <U>elaborate</U> machines.</FONT></P>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Since elaborate machines
  are expensive, they do not pay unless large amounts of goods
  are produced. They can be worked without a loss only if the vent
  of the goods is reasonably assured and if production need not
  be interrupted for want of the primary goods necessary to feed
  the machines. For the merchant this means that all factors involved
  must be on sale... (Polanyi, 1944)</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The introduction of such
'fictive commodities' now allows us to fully exploit the 'formalist'
models defined previously. The factors of production and the price
of the product attain certain discrete values the price. The price
conveys information which is understood at all places and at all
times. Now factors of production and the product it self will
move about freely. Capital will seek low wage areas, labor will
seek industrial centers, currency and commodities will be arbitraged.
Each will seek to maximize its return. Hence, the process of colonialisation
by capital centers, urban expansion and the development of a world
market in the capitalist sense. Domination by a landed elite now
gave way to domination by capital and the operation of 'formal'
economic principles, each of which may exist thousands of miles
distant. The crucial point, however, is that the peasantry remain.
The peasant community may be articulated into capitalist production
without themselves becoming capitalist. In the case of the Amatenango:</FONT></P>

<DIR>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Amatenango presents the
  paradox of a community whose market economy makes it aware of
  economic calculation and relative Costs'and benefits, but a social
  structure and value system which channels economic choice toward
  economic stability and social continuity. Communities like Amatenango
  develop in the face of great economic pressure from the superordinate
  society, or via the extension of economic links with persons
  and social systems in which the rules of choice and values, and
  organizations are congruent with sustained ability to seize or
  make economic opportunity. (Nash in Dalton, 1967)</FONT>
</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">This demands that we extend
our analysis to include what may be the distinguishing feature
of peasant economies: those institutions in which the economy
is &quot;embedded and enmeshed&quot;.</FONT></P>
