<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Nash defines industrial development
as one of three major revolutions in the development of societies
and cultures. The first was the development of culture and tool
using which was diffuse in its emergence, the second and third--
the neolithic settlements and the industrial revolution, respectively--
were successively more restrictive. In terms of production capacity,
which one would assume to be inextricably related to the development
of a society or culture, innovation and the transition from subsistence
production occurs along one of two directions. The first has been
described by Boserup (1965) as an endogenous process resulting
by the demands placed by population growth. This sequence is most
applicable in the context of Western Europe. The second sequence
relates more to the conditions of underdeveloped areas today--
an exogenous sequence under capitalism of &quot;persistent impoverishment
of the former subsistence producers by small minorities of ruling
elite groups, nationally and internationally&quot; (Beckford,
1974) With the penetration of such exogenous processes, certain
internal processes follow. The introduction of a monetary economy,
for example, tends to decrease the amount of time spent on subsistence
with an increase in ceremonial expenditure, and there is typically
internal differentiation and a weakening of the corporate group.
Such a process is not always carried to its logical conclusion,
however, owing to the strength of the peasant social structure
there may be a movement toward nativism' or the 'remade peasant'.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Peasant involvement in the new order
typically begins with labor. Some peasants will migrate to sources
of wage-work, while others become tagriculturalised': the non-agricultural
activities being taken over through,the industrial processes.
The types of peasant production become increasingly determined
by market prices and economizing, rather than by use-value. Shanin
(1976) identifies two general outcomes: with peasantry which are
integrated into industrial society, &quot;regional diversity and
marginal exchange give way to local heterogeneity and national
division of labor while exchange of goods and money traffic increase......
The other possibility is an &quot;agricultural involution... (where)
market exchange remains limited or even a reverse process may
take place....retreating into semi-autarchy determined by poverty....&quot;
The first type arises where industrialisation and investment in
agriculture drew out wage-labor from the peasant community, while
the agricultural sector became mechanised. General exchange-values
take the place of use-values, which leads to the disintegration
of traditional social networks and factors of production are released
to earn their exchange-value on the market.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The task of social disintegration
having succeeded, the more delicate task of integration must proceed.
As opposed to the utilitarian rationale for a laissez-faire pure
economic system, Durkheim stressed &quot;that one of the concomitants
of a growing division of labor is an increase in mechanisms to
coordinate and solidify the interaction among individuals with
increasingly diversified interests&quot;(Smelser in Dalton, 1967).
Even the most highly developed economic system, therefore, is
not without its embedding and enmeshing institutions-- they only
become more removed and increasingly bureaucratic in administration,
rather than lodged in personal relations. Polanyi suggests that
England had been saved from even greater distress owing to the
efforts of the Tudors and Stuarts in slowing down the process
of economic improvement. There improvement brought &quot;havoc
with the habitation of the common people... (and) dehumanized
(them) into slum dwellers...... (Polanyi, 1944) The same pattern
is not unlike that common to developing nations today.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Despite the efforts of disintegration
and reintegration, often contrary results are derived from development
policies than are intended. This is precisely related, again,
to the social nature of the peasant economy. It is this nature
which maintains the peasant village's distance from modernity.
Leveling mechanisms continue to operate and be reinforced during
the process. There is also a selective character of rural emigration
in which those peasants who are motivated to leave the village
are either the wealthiest or poorest strata, hence the most change
prone-- leaving the village even more homogenous and static.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">A more positive illustration is provided
by Nash of Cantel in Meso-America. Here an industry was located
near the village for geographic reasons, allowing the peasantry
to commute from the village to work. Many of the social interrelations
within the community remain undisturbed even as the community
as a whole prospers from the increased income. To quote Nash:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <DIR>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Cantel teaches the general lesson
    that the upheavals in people's lives which often go along with
    industrialisation are not built into the process itself.... They
    are probably, instead, the result of people's seeing themselves
    and others in some way that that does not necessarily correspond
    to reality: Perhaps as passive agents mechanically responding
    to immutable forces, perhaps as pawns in political chess games,
    perhaps as expendable material in economic plans (Nash, 1966)</FONT>
  </DIR>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The integrative capacity at Cantel
is not difficult to grasp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The industrial commuter exemplifies
the same qualities when he commutes downtown for his differentiating
economic activities and returns to the suburb for his integrative
home-oriented activities. The Cantel Indian only differs in that
his home-orientation differs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The second type of situation described
by Shanin, ie. those societies of 'agricultural involution', generally
share a common characteristic: a colonial past and/or neo-colonial
present. The ruling class remains linked with landlordism and
there is a growing urban/rural division within the population.
Investment in agriculture is lacking as the agricultural surplus
is drained out of rural areas by the landed elite for consumption
purposes. The nature of exchange remains principally exploitative
in;,nature. Where once there may ahve been plantations which extracted
the agricultural surplus for the colonial powers, leaving nothing
in the wake in terms of technological change for selfsustaining
growth, there may now be an exploitative relation between the
hinterland and the &quot;mestizos who live in the nuclear city&quot;.
The city maintains the link between the peasant economy and the
central markets of Europe, North America and Japan. The peasant
economy &quot;becomes linked to the national one by a particular
dialectic relation in which the very advance of peasant agriculture
provides the base of industrialisation and urbanisation and contributes
to the destruction of the peasantry&quot; (Shanin)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The economic structure of these societies
are determined by continued domination by the elite class-- often
incorporated into government. The result is a marketable surplus
from the peasant producer and an unequal exchange of resources.
By keeping agricultural wages low, the government may in turn
reduce the prices of agricultural produce, and thereby keep urban
wages low and, finally, keep profits high. At the same time, tariffs
and other trade restrictions have served to foster industrial
development within the political jurisdiction, causing an artificial
price increase in manufactured goods. In turn, the <U>real</U>
wage (in terms of purchasing power) is further reduced for the
agricultural se ctor relative to the urban-industrial sector.
If this peasant subordination did not continue, it is almost certain
that production , for the market would decline (at least in the
short run), meaning that agricultural prices would increase causing
a decline in the real wage of the urban-industrial worker. It
is no wonder, then, that peasant movements receive little support
from their urban counterpart.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Aside from the social elements within
the peasant community already touched upon, in such situations
there are definite societal and economic structures inconducive
to economic improvement within the superordinate system. The basic
feature of such systems is that factor rmrkets are highly imperfect.
The implicit rental rate for land and capital tend to be smaller
for the large landlord than for the household. Moreover, monopsony--
the control of labor wages by controlling production or other
factors of production-- is induced by land concentration and the
use of excessive inputs of capital keeping unemployment high.
Without artificial factor prices, induced by favorable government
policies, labor would be employed more relative to capital in
capital-poor countries, owing to the abundance of the former and
scarcity of the latter. This occurs in small land holdings. Labor
is employed as it was in the traditional peasant model, to the
point where marginal product of labor approaches zero. A high
rate of investment, which in turn would increase the productivity
of labor (by reducing its input), is not necessarily, therefore,
an improvement in the condition of the rural popuulation. Indeed,
as was demonstrated in the rebellion at Morelos, Mexico it may
be the cause of much distress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Government policies support the mechanisation
of large properties at a cost to the small in order to increase
the amount of produce for the market, not the total agricultural
produce. In changing these policies, there would simultaneously
follow an increase in'market prices and an improvement in the
welfare of the rural populations. The evidence remains that despite
the marginal quality of peasant holdings, due to the intensive
agricultural methods employedithese small holdings outproduce
the larger commercial farms per area of land (Griffin, 1974) The
cost of this increased yield is the greater labor input, but as
has been stressed, that input is almost freely obtainable-- having
no opportunity cost-- and if not employed in such a manner, would
form the slum-inhabitants of the burgeoning city. The large farmers,
in contrast, &quot;produced less per hectar, provided less employment,
and were relatively more extravagant in their use of scarce capital
resources. This is a characteristic of large farmers whether or
not they innovate&quot;(Griffin).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The justification of the large farms
is usually grounded still in the motivation to innovate. The small,
near-subsistence producer is said to retain the traditional production
methods even when more effective methods are made available. The
reasons for this is often leveled at the social factors previously
discussed. Yet we know from our micro-analysis that the peasant
remains influenced by market prices and opportunities. The economic
decision is only conditioned by noneconomic criteria. In recognizing
that the peasant unit of production is also a social unit-- generally,
the family-- we know that risks will be minimized where they threaten
the continued welfare of that family. Any new technology to be
adopted on a broad scale in the peasant hinterland must promise
not only larger harvests in good years, but fewer bad years. And
it must do so from the initial implementation. The 'Green Revolution'
did not do this, but required greater capital inputs, irrigation,
etc. which were largely controlled by the large commercial farms.
As a result, the 'Green Revolution' not only affected output but
also the distribution of income. For any innovation to become
accessible to the peasant producer, his basic subsistence needs
must be assured, and it must be accompanied by structural changes--
at least in a reduction of the pre-existing biases against him--
to enable its implementation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The choices for government policy,
regardless of political afiliation, must balance two, oftentimes
conflicting objectives. The first is the development of urban
and industrial,- centers which enable import substitution and
diminish the flight of capital. The second is to minimize the
fragmentation and frustration of therural population. Agriculture
contributes to general economic growth not only in providing the
raw agricultural output, but also in providing factor supplies
(generally labor) and providing linkages with other :sectors of
the economy (in demands for goods and services). In light of the
combined respects, &quot;agriculture's contribution is greatest
where food output is geared heavily in initial stages ... ;where
incomes are evenly distributed and output is rising; and where
there are no great disparities in social relationships&quot; (Beckford)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Policy options will differ according
to political emphasis. The 'betting on the strong' option is the
promotion of large scale capitalist farming. This increases the
flow of produce to the urban sectors, maintains low agricultural
wages, conservatism and conspicuous consumption on the part of
the elites. The peasantry lose their land without being absorbed
into wage labor which &quot;can only lead to severe and ever worsening
social and economic problems&quot;(Shanin) The 'Green Revolution'
in Shanin's estimation provides the testing ground for such an
option. &quot;The poor strata of peasantry lose ground... caught
between on the one hand farms which are rapidly mechanising, increasing
in size and intensively run on capitalist lines, and on the other
the limited labour market in towns&quot; (Ibid)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In contrast, the 'betting on the
mass' throught the implementation of the capital intensive and
efficient family farm implies &quot;fuller employment and better
use of scarce resources in farming together with a broadening
of the market&quot; (Ibid). It has the further advantage of gaining
peasant goodwill, but the restriction of thinly spread state capital
and slow implementation of new techniques. Modifications on this
theme would include 'communal development' and rural cooperatives
as exemplified in the American Mid-West and proposed by Chayanov.
&quot;Such 'verticle integration' of family farms enables them
to benefit from large scale organisation when it pays while not
committing them to it when it does not and leaves the scope for
running cooperation from below&quot; (Ibid). The results so far,
however, are not always encouraging.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Collectivisation, on the other hand,
assumes superiority in large enterprises (which is true only within
a discrete range) and is directed from above. Organisation has
a tendency to be bureaucratically administered and yields anomosity
from the peasantry. The inefficiency and interrelations thus provoked
have in turn been less than satisfactory. &quot;Izvestia recently
noted that it is common to see one freight train loaded with lumber
heading east while another train with a similar load heads west&quot;
(Newsweek, April 12, 1982). The Russian peasant today has been
transformed, or is it just another dominating elite-- the nobles
gave way to the bureaucracy:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <DIR>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Private plots where collective farmers
    can cultivate their own crops account for only 1.5 percent of
    the Soviet Union's farmland, but they produce about one-third
    of its total agricultural output other than grain. Even in this
    area production is stagnant and,;in the case of milk, declining.
    At a time of feed shortages, the state farms almost certainly
    get first call on grain supplies. The private plots have also
    been hurt by the general aging of the farm population as younger
    people flee the rural life. Brezhnev has loosened some of the
    restrictions on what the private plots may raise; he has also
    begun to stress the importance of the plots to the over-all agricultural
    system. But most of these changes have only been tinkering. (Ibid)</FONT>
    <P>&nbsp;
  </DIR>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Beckford suggests a ranking of systems
based upon both economic and non-economic criteria by order of
development potential as follows: the Socialist-People:s communal
(e.g. China); the 'Special Case' (i.e. the commercial fiirm-farm
in capitalist economies; the U.S. Mid-West); the Socialist-Bureaucratic
(e.g. Russia); the 'pure' peasant; the Feudal; and the Plantation
system. It should be reemphasized that if any sort.of land reform
is to be implemented, land access is<B> </B>not sufficient. Land
reform must be accompanied by general agrarian reform:</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <DIR>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The very capacity of the peasant
    to absorb and successfully cultivate new land (and not let it
    slip rapidly into other hands) is conditioned b a variety of
    additional measures: provision of credit and/or equipment, new
    market outlets, reorganization of local authority, services,
    changes in the structure of production.... (Shanin)</FONT>
  </DIR>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Moreover, if we do succeed in re-integrating.the
peasant economies, we should be certain that the result is a definite
improvement. Formal economics might at this juncture absorb some
of the lessons of the substantive methods. With the introduction
of subjective hierarchies of value (which is required in substantive
analysis) concepts such as time (or labor-time) are used as indications
of value. But some assumption as to the value of what labor produces
must still be abstracted from the process (i.e. the surplus value
of labor). As commodities develop an autonomous existence as exchange-values,
rather than use-values, further assumptions must be made. As a
group of alienated individuals, the market prices are discrete
assigned values. But in a broader time and social horizon, such
prices may not indicate the ultimate values. With the introduction
of money, the Siane &quot;will soon know the price of everything
and the value of nothing&quot; (Frankenberg in Firth).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Not only should the methods of production
come under the scrutiny of the economist, but perhaps the products
should themselves. The interrelation of two factors make this
paramount: the emphasis on individual consumption (as opposed
to a social unit), and; the unequal distribution of income.</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <DIR>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Emphasis on the individual, rather
    than the collective, consumption means that many more durable
    consumer goods will be produced than is necessary. Individually
    owned washing machines, television sets and lawn mowers that
    sit idle most of the time use resources that could have been
    used to supply those same consumer durables to all of the people
    on a collective basis (for example, laundromats and community
    centers) ....</FONT>
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">(In) a poor country, a highly unequal
    income distribution means that clinics for organ transplants
    will be built in the capital city instead of water purification
    systems in the villages, automobiles will be manufactured instead
    of buses, country clubs will be constructed instead of schools,
    Coca-Cola plants will be built instead of dairies, and so on.
    Both types of output cannot be produced simultaneously in a country
    having a low level of national income. (Wilber and Weaver, in
    Wilber, 1973)</FONT>
  </DIR>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In many underdeveloped areas, owing
to the structural composition, development is generally tn the
context of consumer oriented luxury goods designed to raise the
urban standard of living rather than the welfare of the greater
population. The process is aggravated by the introduction of the
multinational corporation and its marketing practices. The technologies
of the MNC's are typically capital intensive, increasing the uneveness
of the income distribution, the advertisement techniques of the
oligopolies further illicit the agricultural surplus via the landed
elite into consumption goods as opposed to investment goods.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">With the introduction of industry
into the emerging economies, a further responsibility befalls
the development planner. Following the substantiation of Cantel,
we introduce the notion of 'tools for for conviviality'. The name
was established on social grounds by Illich (1973), but is rampant
in development literature under the technological heading of 'intermediate,
or appropriate technologies'. The technological heading implies
the use of labor intensive tools until an endogenous capital base
is established. In Illich's usage, however, the concern is ultimate,
not transitional:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Every aspect of industrial societies
has become part of a larval system for escalating production and
increasing the demand necessary to justify the total social cost.
For this reason, criticism of bad management, official dishonesty,
insufficient research, or technological lag distracts public attention
from the one issue that counts: careful analysis of the basic
structure of tools as means. It is equally distracting to suggest
that the present frustration is primarily due to the private ownership
of the means of production, and that the public ownership of these
same factories under the tutelage of a planning board could protect
the interest of the majority and lead society to an equally shared
abundance.... The concept of ownership cannot be applied to a
tool that cannot be controlled. The issue at hand, therefore,
is what tools can be controlled in the.public interest.... There
are tools which can be used normally for fully satisfying, imaginative,
and independent work; others tend to be used primarily in activities
best labeled as labor; and. finally, certain machines can only
be operated. (Illich, 1973)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Illich suggests therefore, that the
choice of tools determine in large extent the economic, and hence,
the social relations between those who use them. Convivial tools
would be those which are decentralized (meaning inexpensive),
simple enough to be understood by those who use them (or at least
not intimidating), and structured to satisfy definite social needs
(as opposed to needs defined by sales motivated advertising).
Illich finds himself within the Aristotle-old distinction between
exchange-values and use-values.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Regardless of development objectives
to be pursued and means employed, one thing is certain-- the plight
of the peasant is far from over. The economies and social forces
within the peasant realm and its connections with the new order,
will continue to remain volatile for at least a generation. It
must further be asserted that the foundations of the industrial
order is still shaky-- especially in the emerging nations--and
that the peasantry may outlive yet another superordinate system.</FONT></P>
