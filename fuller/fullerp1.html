<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>IN SCIENTIFIC PROGNOSTICATION we have a condition analogous
to a fact of archery-the farther back you are able to draw your
longbow, the farther ahead you can shoot. For this reason we opened
this book with our &quot;Speculative Prehistory,&quot; taking
us back five million years through four ice ages, and at least
three and one-half million years of scientifically proven presence
of humans on Earth. We are confident of the validity of our speculative
prehistory because it is predicated on naked humans' physical
limits of existence and on environmentally permitted and induced
human behavior and on human artifact-altered environments and
their progressive circumstance-delimiting and capability-increasing
effects. It is also synergetically comprehensive. (229)</P>

<P>In reviewing the full range of humans' presence on Earth we
discover two main evolutionary trendings.</P>

<P>Class-two evolutionary trendings are all those events that
seem to be resultant upon human initiative-taking or political
reforms that adjust to the changes wrought by the progressive
introduction of environment-altering artifacts. All the class-two
evolutionary events tend to flatter human ego and persuade humanity
to deceive itself by taking credit for favorable changes in circumstances
while blaming other humans or &quot;acts of God&quot; for unfavorable
changes. It therefore assumes that humanity is running the Universe
wherefore, if its power-structure leaders decide that it is valid
to cash in all of nature's available riches to further enrich
the present rich or to protect them militarily from attacks by
their assumed enemies - all at the cost of terminating human presence
on planet Earth - that is the power-structure leaders' divine
privilege. (229)</P>

<P>All the class-one evolutionary trending is utterly transcendental
to any human vision, planning, manipulation, and corruption. Class-one
evolution accounts for humans' presence on Earth. It accounts
for their having always been born naked, helpless for months,
and inexperienced - ergo, ignorant, hungry, thirsty, curious,
and therefore fated to learn how to survive only through trial-and-error-won,
progressive accumulation of experience. Class-one evolution accounted
for humanity's all-unexpected invention of verbal (aural, sound)
communication, and thereby the integration of the experience-
won information of the many, whereby the integrated information
of the many increased the capability of humanity at large to cope
with the exigencies of life. It is class-one evolution that led,
after the progressive integration of the total experience-won
information, to the unpredicted invention of writing or visual
communication, by means of which the dead could speak to the living
and within which total written information history human mind
from time to time discovered repetitive patterns, which in turn
sometimes led to the discovery of generalized scientific principles.
(229, 230)</P>

<P>Class-one evolution had human fathers and mothers for multimillions
of years serving as the memory-bank authority that showed children
what they could safely eat and how to communicate. The parents
told the children what they could or could not do to get along
with the &quot;system&quot; into which they were born. The parents
told the children what they should or should not believe. To history's
children the parents were &quot;the authority.&quot; The myriad
esoteric, illiterate ways in which the parents communicated to
their children were parroted by the children. Thus were esoteric
dialects proliferated until their many progressive deviations
multiplied the many initially different world languages. (230)</P>

<P>It was class-one evolution that in the mid-1920s disclosed
to the world's children and their parents that the voice coming
over the radio had more up-to-the-minute information regarding
many more subjects than had the parents. The parents did not tell
the children that the radio people had more authoritative information
- it was self-evident to the children, who witnessed their parents
running next door to the neighbors to tell them what the radio
people had just told them. The people who were selected as broadcasters
by the radio stations were selected for the commonality of their
diction in contradistinction to the millions of esoteric jargons
with which the parents had communicated. The radio people were
also picked for the size and richness of their vocabularies and
the facility with which they drew upon such conventionalized vocabularies.
(230)</P>

<P>Because it was self-evident to the children that the radio
people were greater authorities than their parents, the children
now emulated the diction and vocabularies of the radio people.
Not to be belittled in their children's estimation, the parents
learned the commonly accepted radio people's pronunciation of
an ever-enlarging conventional vocabulary. Within half a century
(two human generations) this completely altered and improved the
world's languages. (230, 231)</P>

<P>The speed of sound is approximately 700 miles per hour. The
speed of electromagnetic radiation is 700 million miles per hour.
Sound can travel only in conducting mediums - for instance, in
the Earth's atmosphere. Electromagnetic radiation can travel on
indefinitely through Universe. The amount of information humans
can acquire visually is a millionfold greater in range, speed,
and meaning than is the information they acquire aurally. (231)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The university and college students who became the first to
make the world news as dissidents in 1965 and 1966 were born in
the years TV came into the American home. The Class of '66ers
were the first human beings to be reared by the &quot;third parent,&quot;
whose TV voice and TV presence were often heard and felt by the
children much more than those of the two blood parents. TV daily
briefed them visually ergo, vividly-on the worldaround news, regarding
the world's continual aches, pains, disasters, Olympic triumphs,
etc. (231)</P>

<P>The young were saying, &quot;I know that Dad and Mom love me
to pieces, and I love them to pieces, but they don't know what
it's all about. They come home from the office or golf links or
hairdressers and sit down to beer and small talk or 'sitcoms.'
They have nothing to do with our going into Vietnam. They have
nothing to do with our going to the Moon. They have nothing to
do with anything except earning a living - and spending it on
TV-advertised goods. The whole world is in great trouble. My compassion
is for all the people anywhere who are in trouble. Since the older
people don't seem to know what is going on and are too preoccupied
with irrelevancies, I and my contemporaries must do our own thinking
and find out what needs to be done to make the world work.&quot;
(231)</P>

<P>As we wrote in the opening lines of our &quot;Self-Disciplines,&quot;
Chapter 4, up to the time of the radio the older people were always
saying to the young, &quot;Never mind what you think. Listen.
We are trying to teach you.&quot; With the TV making it clear
to the young that the parents did not know much about anything
and were not &quot;the authority,&quot; the young, responding
to intuition, said to themselves, &quot;I am going to have to
do my own thinking and take my own actions.&quot; Nonetheless,
they were utterly unskilled in world affairs, highly idealistic,
and easily exploitable. (231)</P>

<P>The abrupt, spontaneous historical events on the Berkeley campus
of the University of California and elsewhere occasioned youth's
discarding forever the authority of their elders. The Class of
1966 shocked the world by saying that it felt no special loyalty
to its families, its university, its state, or its nation. The
youth of the Class of 1966 were thought by the oldsters to be
shockingly immoral and lacking in idealism. Not so! They were
as idealistic and full of compassion as any child has ever been,
but their loyalty was to all humanity. They were no longer the
victims of local class or race bias. Their idealism was at first
skillfully exploited by the psycho-guerrilla warfaring of the
communist-capitalist secret operations. Soon the young realized
that they were using their heads for punching bags and cudgel
targets instead of for thinking. Many of their numbers began to
listen to my lectures about solving problems by appropriate technology
instead of by physical struggling or political revolution. Informed
by me, they began to say mankind can do anything it wants. &quot;Why
don't our officials and families stop talking about their local
biases and wasting wealth on warring - all because they assume
that 'war is necessary' simply because there does not seem to
be enough to take care of even one-half of humanity's needs.&quot;
(231, 232)</P>

<P>The young ones asked, &quot;Why not up the performances per
units of invested resources and thus make enough to go around?&quot;
Their elders repeated, &quot;Never mind what you think,&quot;
so the young ones stopped asking. (232)</P>

<P>Occurring after millions of years of the absolute unquestioned
caring for the young by the authority of the elders, this metaphysical
cutoff - like its physical counterpart, the cutting of the umbilical
cord after the child is born and has access to its own oxygen
- occurred when humanity had acquired enough relevantly critical
information to be able to proceed on its own initiatives divested
of the many misinterpretations by the elders as to the total significance
of the total information. This cut-off experience is typical of
all class-one evolution, which is always transcendental to all
class-two evolution - to human planning, contriving, manipulation,
or corruption. (232)</P>

<P>Also typical of class-one evolution are the two trends we have
mentioned so many times in the previous chapters - the invisible
chemical, metallurgical, and electronic production of ever-more-efficient
and satisfyingly effective performance with the investment of
ever-less weight and volume of materials per unit function formed
or performed - i.e., ephemeralization accomplished within ever-less
increments of time - i.e., acceleration. (232)</P>

<P>These coordinate class-one evolutionary trendings, which have
been manifest for three quarters of a century, are as yet unrecognized
by any world economists, heads of state, or business leaders.
Though there is a popular intuition that acceleration may be in
evidence, it is not officially heeded. Individuals amongst political
and business leaders are often aware of changing conditions, such
as that which makes suddenly available a pocket calculator or
a quartz watch. They do not comprehend that these individual &quot;goodies&quot;
are parts of overall ephemeralization and acceleration trending
that, within only three quarters of a century, has converted those
enjoying an adequate and pleasing standard of living from less
than 1 percent of all humanity in 1900 to 60 percent of all humanity
in 1980, the latter enjoying an even higher standard of living
than had been enjoyed before 1900 by any of the world's kings
or financial potentates of all history. Class-one evolution alone
accounts for the doubling within this century of the life &quot;expectancy&quot;
of that 60 percent of all humanity which, by 1980, has had its
standard of living so spectacularly advanced. (232, 233)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>All technical evolution has a fundamental behavior pattern.
First there is scientific discovery of a generalized principle,
which occurs as a subjective realization by an experimentally
probing individual. Next comes objective employment of that principle
in a special case invention. Next the invention is reduced to
practice. This gives humanity an increased technical advantage
over the physical environment. If successful as a tool of society,
the invention is used in bigger, swifter, and everyday ways. For
instance, it goes progressively from a little steel steamship
to ever-bigger fleets of constantly swifter, higher-powered ocean
giants. (233)</P>

<P>There comes a time, however, when we discover other ways of
doing the same task more economically - as, for instance, when
we discover that a 200-ton transoceanic jet airplane - considered
on an annual round-trip frequency basis - can outperform the passenger-carrying
capability of the 85,000-ton Queen Mary. (233)</P>

<P>All the technical curves rise in tonnage and volumetric size
to reach a &quot;giant&quot; peak, after which progressive miniaturization
sets in. After that, a new and more economical art takes over
and then goes through the same cycle of doing progressively more
with less, first by getting bigger and taking advantage, for instance,
of the fact that doubling the length of a ship increases its wetted
surface fourfold but increases its payload volume eightfold. Inasmuch
as the cost of driving progressively bigger ships through the
water at a given speed increases in direct proportion to the increase
in friction of the wetted surface, the eightfolding of payload
volume gained with each fourfolding of wetted surface means twice
as much profit for the same effort each time the ship's length
is doubled. (233)</P>

<P>This principle of advantage gain through geometric size increase
holds true for ships of both air and water. Eventually doubling
of length of seagoing ships finally runs into trouble. For instance,
an ocean liner made more than 1000 feet long would have to span
between two giant waves and would have to be doubled in size to
do so. If doubled in size once more, however, she could no longer
be accommodated by the sizes of the great world canals, dry docks,
or harbor depths. At this point the miniaturization of doing more
with less first ensues through substitution of an entirely new
art - David's slingshot over Goliath's club operated from beyond
reach of the giant. (233, 234)</P>

<P>This overall and inexorable trending to do more with less is
known sumtotally as &quot;progressive ephemeralization.&quot;
Ephemeralization trends toward an ultimate doing of everything
with nothing at all which is a trend of the omni-weighable physical
to be mastered by the omniweightless metaphysics of intellect.
(234)</P>

<P>All the missile-hurling arts of man and men's warring or fighting
to the death have followed this same fundamental evolutionary
pattern of bigger, then smaller. (234)</P>

<P>Assuming that there were not and never will be enough vital
support resources to go around, we conclude that there must be
repeating eventualities in wars to see which side could pursue
its most favored theory of survival under fundamental inadequacies.
Humanity has continually done more killing with less human effort
at greater and greater distances and at ever-higher speeds and
with ever-increasing accuracy. (234)</P>

<P>The killing went from a thrown stone to a spear to a sling
to a bow-and-arrow to a pistol, a musket, a cannon, and so on
until man used the great weapons-carrying battleships. Suddenly
a little two-ton, torpedo-carrying airplane sank a 45,000-ton
battleship, and then the 2,000-miles-per-hour airplane was outperformed
by the 16,000-miles-per hour, atom-bomb-carrying rocket of minuscule
weight in comparison to the bomb-carrying plane. If world warring
persists as a consequence of the concept of &quot;survival only
of the fittest minority,&quot; there will come the approximately
weightless death rays operating at 700 million miles per hour.
(234)</P>

<P>At the present point of history the uranium bomb has been displaced
by the hydrogen bomb, and then it was discovered that if either
side used that new greatest weapon, both sides and the rest of
humanity would perish, so the biggest weapon could not be used.
Nor could the equally large and mutually destructive biological
or chemical gas warfaring. Both sides then discovered that killing
of the enemy's people was not their objective. (234)</P>

<P>Killing the enemy's ideology is the objective. Killing the
enemy's people brings sympathy and support for the enemy from
the rest of the world, and &quot;gaining the good opinion and
support of the rest of the world&quot; is one of the new world-warring's
objectives. (234)</P>

<P>At this point both sides have started to explore the waging
of more war with lesser-more limited-killing but more politically
and economically devastating techniques. Just as ephemeralization
employed ever-more-minuscule instruments and thus took technology
out of the limited ranges of the human senses into the vast and
invisible ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum reality, so too
has major warfaring almost disappeared from the visible contacts
of human soldiery and entered into the realm of invisible psychology.
(234, 235)</P>

<P>In the new invisible miniaturization phase of major world-warring
both sides carry on an attention-focusing guerilla warfare (as
was conducted in Vietnam) while making their most powerful attacks
through subversion, vandalism, and skillful agitation of any and
all possible areas of discontent within the formally assumed enemy's
home economics. In carrying on this new and unfamiliar world-warring
they do not have to send ideological proselytizers to persuade
the people of the other side to abandon their home country's political
system and adopt that of their former enemies. Instead they can
readily involve, induce, and persuade individuals of the other
side to look for discontent wherever it manifests itself and thereafter
to &quot;amplify&quot; that condition by whatever psychological
means until the situation erupts in public confusion, demonstrations,
terrorism, etc. The idea is to make a mess of the other's economy
and customs and thus to discredit the other's political system
in the eyes of the rest of the world and to destroy the enemy
people's confidence in their own system. (235)</P>

<P>Because the active operators are sometimes engaged on a basis
of just gratifying their own personal discontent, they are often
unaware that they are acting as agents. Because almost everyone
has at least one discontent, a well-trained conscious agent can
invoke the multiplyingly effective but unwitting agency of hundreds
of other discontent promoters and joiners-in ever-larger, more
amplified, masses. (235)</P>

<P>As a consequence of this new invisible phase of world-war trending,
a most paradoxical condition exists. The highly idealistic youth
of college age who are convinced that they are demonstrating against
war are, despite the most humane and compassionate motives, often
in fact the front-line soldiers operating as unwitting &quot;shock
troops.&quot; Meanwhile the conventionally recognized soldiers
engaged in visible &quot;war-zone&quot; warfare (either of ambush
or open battle) are carrying on only a secondary - albeit often
mortally fatal - decoy operation. (235)</P>

<P>This invisible world-around warring to destroy the enemy's
economy wherever it is operative, above all by demonstrating its
homeland weaknesses and vulnerabilities to the rest of the world,
and thus hoping to destroy the confidence of the enemy people
in themselves, is far more devastating than could be a physical
death ray, for it does everything with nothing. Furthermore it
operates as &quot;news,&quot; which moves around the Earth by
electromagnetic waves operating at 700 million miles per hour.
(235)</P>

<P>At the moment the highly controlled political states have a
great defensive advantage over the &quot;open, freedom-nurturing&quot;
states by virtue of the former's controlled &quot;news.&quot;
For it is the omniexcitable news in the &quot;free&quot; countries
that is primarily exploited to publish and spread and thus create
a chain reaction of dismay throughout any and all of their organized
discontent actions. (236)</P>

<P>With the United States and Russia jointly spending over $200
billion a year getting ready for an ultimate showdown between
them, they each average about $20 billion a year waging psycho-guerilla
warfare. Both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. were intent to break
down the other one's economy before coming to the far more costly
all-out war. The brilliantly trained individuals in Russia who
came out to train other individuals in America did so in such
a manner that those trained in America had no idea that what they
were being excited into doing had anything to do with Russia.
The American students' idealism was often brilliantly exploited
by Russia to break down America's confidence in advanced education.
Theretofore Americans had such blind confidence in education that
they would elect any politicians promising to provide state-financed
advanced-education facilities. (236)</P>

<P>What the Russians' strategists knew was that the presidents
of the U.S.A. universities, public or private, were &quot;sitting
ducks&quot; for their psychological shooting. The university presidents
of both private and state universities were primarily involved
in the politics of raising funds for their institutions. The presidents
had no internal &quot;defenses&quot; because they had never had
need for them. They found that neither the faculty nor the students
knew much about the presidents and that it would be very easy
to attack their on-campus positions. They could effectively exaggerate
any faults manifest by the presidents. (236)</P>

<P>Within one year the presidents of 100 universities of America
were &quot;shot down.&quot; None of them were defended by their
faculties, whose numbers were scared to death of losing their
tenure. The determination of the students to do their own thinking
was readily exploited in attacking the university presidents.
(236)</P>

<P>While all the foregoing curves of the rising and falling of
the technical evolution of weaponry have taken place, there has
also occurred, all unnoticed by all parties to the warfaring,
a vast &quot;fallout&quot; from the &quot;defense&quot; technology
into the domestic technology of ephemeralization's doing ever
more with less. Within two-thirds of a century this unnoticed
and inadvertent fallout has converted 40 percent of total humanity
from have-not-ness to a high standard of living have-ness and
makes clear that the only way all of humanity may be elevated
to such advantage is by further acceleration of the technical
invention revolution. (236)</P>

<P>It becomes evident that all of youth's world-around clamor
for peace can only be realized through technological revolution,
which will do so much more with so much less per each function
as ultimately to produce enough to support all of humanity. It
is also clear that such a task can only be accomplished by the
technical design revolution. (237)</P>

<P>As those many who have become involved in the new invisible
warfaring discover that their aims can be attained only through
the design revolution, all the young world-around idealists will
have to face up to the question of whether they prefer to keep
on agitating simply because they have come to enjoy a sense of
power and importance by so doing. All who are really dedicated
to the earliest possible attainment of economic and physical success
for all humanity - and thereby realistically to eliminate war
- will have to shift their efforts from the political arena to
participation in the design revolution. The latter course involves
the development of ever-self-regenerating and improving scientific
and technical competence. In turn this means that the individual
must plunge earnestly and dedicatedly into initiating self-development,
using the resources of the educational system. (237)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>All the aforementioned class-one evolutionary trending provides
powerful long-distance prognostication data. Keeping track of
the integrated ephemeralization and acceleration trends and their
socioeconomic resultants, per each world human, made possible
my 1938 Nine Chains to the Moon and my 1950 magazine-published
Prognostication that by 2000 A.D. all humanity either would be
enjoying a higher but generally unfamiliar standard of living
than any humans had ever known - or would have altogether perished.
(237)</P>

<P>This book has already mentioned many of these class-one evolutionary
trendings. (237)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In naval science we have four scientifically developed prognosticating
arts. In my own semantic formulating &quot;prognosticating&quot;
is both subjective and objective: subjective - &quot;if I don't
do anything, such and such will happen&quot;; objective - &quot;if
I do so and so, such and such will happen.&quot; Pure science
means &quot;setting in order the facts of experience and therefrom
deducing generalized principles if and when they are manifest.&quot;
Applied science means &quot;the development of technological procedures
for objective employment of a plurality of the generalized principles.&quot;
Art means &quot;the skillful realization of humanly satisfying
or challenging special case applications of the theoretical schemes
of applied science.&quot; (237)</P>

<P>The number-one naval prognosticating science and art is that
of designing and producing the generalized tools - machine tools
- that, when housed and assembled in navy yards or floating dry
docks, can produce both macro and micro special-case tools - with
both the generalized and special-case tools operative at degrees
of dimensional controls beyond that of human sight; at temperatures
above and below humans' organic tolerance; at weights and sizes
beyond human muscle-maneuverability; at electromagnetic frequencies
beyond the range of human optical or tactile tunability or tolerance;
at quantation determination and integration of metallurgical and
chemical formulations, in temperature and pressure regions beyond
humans' direct sensorially apprehending control. (238)</P>

<P>The number-two naval prognosticating science and art is that
in which, employing the number-one prognosticating science and
art tools, we design fleets of ships and special case ships and
other special case tools as a complex of intersupportive technology
capable of coping with nature's conditions at the interface of
sea and sky while traveling on, over, or under the seas to any
part of the world reachable by the deep water's continuum - i.e.,
to three-quarters of all the surface of planet Earth; with the
sea-transport capability of integrating the world's remotely occurring,
unique, and intercomplementary physical resources; and with the
ability to protect such sea commerce against any and all pirates
or others hostile to class-two evolutionary phenomena. (238)</P>

<P>The number-three naval prognosticating science and art is that
of celestial navigation, which permits us to reliably prognosticate
the arrival of our ship anywhere around the world at such and
such an hour and on such and such a date. The number-four naval
prognosticating science and art is that of ballistics - &quot;the
art and science of controlling the trajectory of an explosively
hurled missile.&quot; Ballistics is divided into two parts - interior
and exterior. Interior ballistics deals with all the controllable
variables governing the trajectory of the gun's explosively hurled
missile, which controllable variables are operative before the
gun is fired; exterior ballistics deals with all the controllable
variables operative after the gun is fired. These controllable
interior- and exterior-ballistics variables altogether govern
the trajectory of the gun's explosively hurled missiles. (238)</P>

<P>Interior-ballistics variables include the design of the gun,
its bore, its length, its metallurgy, its expansion and contraction
in changing temperatures, and similar factors. Interior ballistics
is also concerned with the design of the missile itself, with
the gunpowder to be used, and with the temperature of that powder.
The interior variables are exhaustively studied, scientifically
recorded and controlled. (238)</P>

<P>The exterior-ballistics variables relate to the direction and
velocity of the winds blowing between the firing ship and the
target ship. The exterior-ballistics variables include all weather
conditions. They are concerned with the course and speed of the
gun-firing ship as well as of the target ship. The exterior-ballistics
variables are numerous but not as numerous as the interior-ballistics
variables. The exterior-ballistics variables include the information
regarding the relative accuracy of the previously fired missile
and the swiftly calculated corrections to bring the trajectory
on to the target. (239)</P>

<P>In the science of ballistics the variables entering into the
problem of firing from a swiftly moving, steerable ship on a heaving
sea at a variably steerable target ship moving at unannounced
variable speeds on a heaving sea are much more numerous than the
variables entering into the firing of a gun from a fixed position
on the dry land toward another fixed-position target on the same
dry land. (239)</P>

<P>In naval gunnery in the precomputer days large charts, containing
titles and spaces for all the known variable data of both interior
and exterior ballistics, were printed. These charts were laid
out and tacked to a great table in the &quot;plotting room&quot;
in the most structurally protected positions within the bowels
of the ship. All the interior-ballistics data was corrected when
any of its data changed and was immediately entered onto the chart.
There was no use entering any exterior-ballistics data until the
enemy ship was located, after which all the up-to-the-minute-and-second
changing data of the exterior ballistics were entered onto the
charts. When all the data were in, complex mathematical integration
of the data took place, and the proper angles of elevation and
horizontal compass orientation of the guns themselves were arrived
at. Guns were at first individually, then coordinatedly, aimed
at the target ship by both horizontal and vertical angle controls,
being separately and continuously human-eye-and-hand aimed at
the target ship by easily spun hand-wheels geared to power-driven
equipment that kept the big guns in constant adjustment to the
rolling, pitching, and yawing of the firing ship. The rate of
changing of interior-ballistics data was - and as yet is - very
slow compared to the rate of change of the data of exterior ballistics.
(239)</P>

<P>As a naval officer I was once concerned with all these matters.
I became gradually interested in the possibility that all the
variables involved in naval ballistics might be identified with
all the variables operative in the most complex problems of Universe.
I intuited that the combined sciences of navigation and ballistics
might embrace all the variables governing Universe-event prognostication.
It could be that: (1) navy yard industrialization, (2) fleet operation
and individual ship design, (3) astronavigation, and (4) ballistics
constituted the four &quot;special case&quot; corner complexes
of a generalized tetrahedral complex of variable design factors
governing all human-mind-controllable participation in all cosmic,
alternative-intertransforming potentials. (239, 240)</P>

<P>It was eminently clear that astronomy, enormously advantaged
by Newton's mass-interattraction law, having acquired comprehensive
data regarding the ever-changing interpositioning of celestial
bodies, groups of bodies, and galaxies of bodies, was extremely
successful in prognosticating for many years, centuries, and millennia
ahead the relative interpositioning of all known celestial bodies
to split-second accuracy almost anywhere within millions of light-years
around and away from Earth. We could say that the more cosmically
comprehensive the consideration, the more accurate the prognosticating.
(240)</P>

<P>I therefore decided to always include the most micro-macro
cosmically inclusive data in all my prognosticating. Obviously
this was not &quot;crystal-balling&quot; nonsense but a very elegantly
inclusive and incisive integration of the four naval sciences
and arts of prognosticating. (240)</P>

<P>Quite clearly the four special case design systems of the naval
sciences and arts can be generalized to accommodate the realization
of all the objective initiatives of humanity. The four-cornered
tetrahedron is the minimum structural system in Universe. It excludes
all the irrelevant information of Universe and includes all the
information relevant to the system. The tetrahedral structure
system has six unique interrelationships existing among the system's
four unique groups of system variables. (240)</P>

<P>We have also mentioned elsewhere in this book and in other
books the differentiation between craft and industrial tools -
i.e., craft tools are all the tools that can be invented and produced
by one individual alone in the wilderness, such as spears, bows
and arrows, pottery, baskets, fire, etc., whereas the industrial
tools are all the tools that cannot be produced by one human.
Because it takes two humans to produce the need to communicate
and to invent the means of that communication, we say that the
spoken word was the first industrial tool. &quot;In the beginning
[of industrialization - i.e., technologically effective human
cooperation] was the word.&quot; The spoken and comprehended word
greatly expedited the development of humanity's information on
how to cope with life's challenges. (240)</P>

<P>The four naval sciences and arts make it possible for us to
sort out the human capabilities provided by class-one- evolution-
developed industrialization as a human-cooperative-interadvantaging
system-differentiated from all the illusory propaganda of industrialization's
exploitation by exclusively monetary-profit-motivated business
or personal-kudos- profit-motivated politics. Our &quot;Legally
Piggily&quot; chapter clearly recounts the manner in which business
took over industrialization for its own special-case self-advantaging.
See this Time magazine item of August 6, 1979, to clarify the
aptness of the word &quot;Piggily.&quot; (240)</P>

<P>Those Record Oil Company Profits</P>

<P>With memories of long gasoline lines still fresh, the earnings
reported by many oil companies last week could hardly be expected
to be greeted by cheers. All told, the industry had its best second
quarter ever. Profits of the 23 biggest U.S. firms totaled $5.47
billion, a rise of 66% over the same period last year. Among the
five large international companies, Texaco's earnings leaped by
132% to $365 million. Earnings of the others: Exxon, up 20% to
$830 million; Mobil, up 38% to $404 million; Socal, up 61% to
$412 million; and Gulf, up 65% to $291 million. These gains came
on top of strong earnings in the first quarter. For the first
half, the combined profits of the five giants came to $4.6 billion,
or an increase of 49% over the same period last year.</P>

<P>See also p. 401 of Chronology in Appendix 11. (241)</P>

<P>The strictly government-operated NASA Apollo Project - its
Cape Canaveral blast-off base in Florida; its Mission Control
Center in Houston, Texas; its design- and theory-development base
in Alabama; and its administration headquarters in Washington,
D.C. - employed business's industrial facilities but was a human-endeavor
cooperating project. It held at bay any importantly diverting
manifests of selfishness, even amongst its dramatically publicized
astronauts. Their individual names have faded into a dim admixture
of identities - omnisublimated by the magnificent demonstration
of humanity's industrially cooperative capability to accomplish
history's most imaginatively &quot;impossible,&quot; scientifically
&quot;possible&quot; feat-rocket-ferrying of humans over to the
Moon and returning them safely back on board our Spaceship Earth.
(241)</P>

<P>We now directly address the accomplishing by humanity of a
less visually dramatic but far more difficult task - that of rendering
comprehensively and eternally successful a failure-prone, competitively
greedy, selfishly wasteful, fearful, and inferiority-conditioned
humanity - and of doing so in a decade. (241)</P>

<P>Starting in 1927 (fifty-three years ago) I developed an as-comprehensiveas-possible
inventory of relevant scientific and industrial data and set about
making systemically scientific prognostications regarding trends
affecting our Spaceship Earth and all of its passengers. This
attempted scientific prognosticating involved the comprehensive
inventorying of resources aboard our Spaceship Earth. These resources
broke down into all the energy associative as matter and all the
energy dissociative as radiation. The metaphysical resources broke
down into all the inventory of generalized principles and all
the inventory of special case knowledge considerations. (241)</P>

<P>To ensure that I was comprehensively adequate in dealing with
cosmicscale prognosticating, I undertook in 1927 and thereafter
to discover and scientifically demonstrate nature's own mathematical
coordinate system. I had intuitively initiated that search in
1899, at the age of four. This latter search and its successful
discovery of that cosmic-coordination system is treated with both
comprehensively and incisively in my two-volume Synergetics (Macmillan,
1975 and 1979) - each volume about 800 pages. All those who would
like to understand the relatively high accuracy of my prognosticating
science will find it necessary to become students of those two
volumes of Synergetics. They make clear that I have found a method
of guaranteeing that my prognostications include all relevant
variables. (241, 242)</P>

<P>For those who do not have time to study Synergetics or my books
such as Nine Chains to the Moon, I will point out such studies
as my 760-year-long chart of the chemical element isolations by
humans, which discloses the interrelationship of pure science
with technological science as applied to world-encircling, human-protecting
and -transporting, environment controls and the accelerating acceleration
in human evolution that it undeniably discloses. (242)</P>

<P>In 1942 I sought a means of discovering whether any regular
rate of occurrence of scientific events existed. I, of course,
discovered that the relative importance of a suitable cut and
classification of the events into pure and not-so-pure scientific
events had first to be accomplished. (242)</P>

<P>As I started so to do, I immediately realized that there was
one single pure-science set of events that belonged to one family
- that is, the history of human scientists' progressive isolation
of the family of ninety-two regenerative chemical elements - a
family of exactly and successively numbered members whose membership
qualifications could not be confused - one electron, one proton;
two electrons and two protons. I decided to make a chart of the
isolations plotted against time. (242)</P>

<P>The first known isolation by a human - that of arsenic- occurred
in Italy in 1250 A.D. So I designed my chart to be 760 years long,
running from 1250 A.D. to 2010 A.D. I made my chart high enough
to accommodate twenty posturanium isolations, should any occur.
One year after I made and posted my chart, the first posturanium
element was isolated. The last of the first ninety-two to be isolated
- promethium, chemical element #61 - was not discovered until
1954, twelve years after I designed and posted the chart. The
preuranium element isolations did not occur without regularity.
I planned the designing of my 760-year-long chart in such a manner
that vertical room was left for 112 horizontal steps, so that
as each element became isolated, the position of it went one step
higher. When history opens, humans had already at some earlier
times isolated and put to use nine chemical elements. Nobody has
any idea how, when, and where the isolations of carbon, lead,
tin, mercury, silver, copper, sulphur, gold, and iron occurred.
They were found already in use in different parts of the world
when humans first made record of the fact long before 1250 A.D.
Because nine isolations had already occurred, I started plotting
my chart nine steps high. I posted arsenic, chemical element #33,
on the tenth step. The next isolation came 200 years later - chemical
element # 5 1, antimony. This was followed by a 220-year hiatus
running to 1670, when science isolated chemical element # 15,
phosphorus. Another sixty-two-year lag brought us to the isolation
of chemical element #27, cobalt, in 1732, and later in the same
year element #78, platinum. Thereafter they arrived at an average
rate of one every two years. (242, 244)</P>

WIDTH="700" HEIGHT="433" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The rate accelerated markedly for the next forty years until
element #5, boron, was isolated; during those forty years thirty-one
other elements were isolated. Between boron, in 1810, and gallium,
element # 31, there is a slowing down in the rate, with seventeen
more elements being isolated. Between gallium and europium, chemical
element #63, another twelve were isolated. There is a very steady
rate of acquisition by humans of the next five isolated chemical
elements - from europium to polonium, element #84. Then there
is a marked slowing down of the rate of isolation from actinium,
# 89, to rhenium, #75. In the isolation of the next five elements,
technetium, #43, to plutonium, #94, there is an almost vertical
rate of isolating, all five isolations taking place during 1930-1931
although not announced until years later. Between 1932 and 1969
ten elements were isolated, from curium, element #96, to lawrencium,
element #103 - the 103rd successive isolation. Not only is there
a very steady rate of climb of these transuranium element isolatins
but all of them are successively isolated in the order of their
successive atomic numbers, whereas none of the pre-uranium - before
element #92 - isolations occur by their successive numbers. (244)</P>

<P>What we have been witnessing is a series of accelerations and
slowdowns. The accelerations always occur in peacetime and the
slowdowns in wartime. In wartime the military uses what the scientists
developed in peacetime. Quite clearly the purest of pure science
activity, chemical-element isolating, occurs under peaceful conditions.
(244)</P>

<P>This whole 760-year curve of pure-science isolations is altogether
a curve of acceleration against calendar time. I then recalled
that what pure science does today does not get into the academic
curricula for a few years. A few years later again applied science
makes special case objective use of the pure-science finding as
some invention. Use of the invention by industry begins to alter
the environment of the everyday happenings. The altered environment
calls for an evolutionary advancement of everyday human life.
(244)</P>

<P>I then said to myself that history makes it clear that environmental
advancements alter life-styles and introduce new economic eras.
(244)</P>

<P>Because environmental-technology advancements embodying the
technical advancements are clearly implemented by pure science's
discoveries, and the altered environments introduce new eras in
human experience, I asked myself to isolate out from all other
inventing of history the unique stages of human-advantaging environment
controls that made it possible for humans to thrive under conditions
in which the humans would, but for the new environment control,
perish and, from within the uniquely advanced life-style within
the environment, accomplish control of energies operating outside
the environment control, and therewith propel the environmentcontrolling
device and its human occupants in one occupant-controlled complete
circuit of the Earth. (244, 245)</P>

<P>Along the top of the chart, in 1520, we see how Magellan used
a sailing vessel in which he went most of the way around the world
before he was killed. His crew completed the circumnavigation,
which took two years. Three hundred fifty years later, humans
circumnavigated the globe in a steel steamship. Seventy-five years
later, they circumnavigated in a special-alloy aluminum airplane.
Thirty-five years later, they circumnavigated in an exotic metals
rocket. The wooden sailing ship took two years to circumnavigate;
the steel steamship, two months; the aluminum airplane took two
weeks and the exotic metals rocket capsule took only a little
over one hour to encircle the planet Earth. (245)</P>

<P>In the successive circumnavigation arts no one at each successive
stage could dream of the next stage of circumnavigation. We have
on this chart the curve of the basic acceleration of science accomplishments
as plotted against time. (245)</P>

<P>We have on the chart a second-degree acceleration manifest
in the contraction of the lags between the successive circumnavigation
from 350 years to sixty-five to thirty years between four states
of the art of circumnavigation and a third-degree acceleration
manifest in the contraction of time taken to circumnavigate from
two years ... to two months ... to two weeks ... to one hour.
It is implicit in the rate of contraction between completely inconceivable
later arts that by 1985 we should be able to transmit humans around
the globe by radio scanning or an equivalently unexpected means.
(245)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>For those who wish to gain only a cursory concept of my prognosticating
I point to my fifty-three-year-maintained curves of ephemeralization
as manifest in a number of charts - for instance, the one recording
the annually decreasing pounds-per-delivered-horsepower of aircraft
engines. The tenth-anniversary issue of Fortune magazine (February
1940) has an article I prepared on industrialization in which
many charts of ephemeralization in various technologies are shown.
In such comprehensive surveying of human experiences and the lessons
we have learned it became progressively clearer that humans were
given their minds to discover generalized principles and to employ
those principles objectively in special case technologies. That
led me to assume that the class-two evolution was a designed-in
but sometime-to-be-terminated phase of class-one evolution. It
seemed logical, as humans progressed from absolute ignorance-learning
only by trial-and- error - that they would go through a very long
period of doing all the right things for all the wrong reasons.
Quite clearly nature did not tell the honeybee to go out and crosspollinate
the vegetation. What nature did was to chromosomically program
the honeybee to go after honey and inadvertently - at right angles
- to crosspollinate the vegetation. What nature told humanity
chromosomically was, &quot;I'm hungry, my kids are hungry; I'm
cold, my kids are cold. Go after that food and that coat. They
cost money - go after money. They say you have to earn it. OK,
I'll earn it.&quot; Buzz, buzz, honey-money bee. No human chromosomes
say make the world work for everybody - only mind can tell you
that. (245, 246)</P>

<P>In support of the integrity of ecology's complex regeneration
of life on planet Earth, class-one evolution first designed all
the vegetation to photosynthetically (syntropically) convert the
randomly occurring entropic Sun radiation into highly orderly
molecular structures, which are consumed by other orderly molecule-proliferating
biological organisms. That syntropic complex of ecological interactions
not only made possible the gradual conduct of human society by
mind instead of by cunning and muscle but also led to human minds'
consciously acting as local-in-Universe information-harvesters
and local-in-Universe problem-solvers, all in support of the integrity
of eternally regenerative Universe. (246)</P>

<P>It seemed that the time would come evolutionarily when humans
might have acquired enough knowledge of generalized principles
to permit a graduation from class-two (entropically selfish) evolution
into class-one (syntropically cooperative) evolution, thereafter
making all the right moves for all the right reasons. (246)</P>

<P>This book should make it quite evident that I think humanity
has now reached that critical moment of potential transformation
of humans' affairs from class-two evolution into class-one evolution.
Assuming that to be so, we look upon &quot;Legally Piggily&quot;
(see Chapter 3) as the last and highest tide of doing all the
wrong things for the unknown right reasons, just before reaching
the condition of all of humanity having acquired enough of the
right information to graduate from class-two evolutionary entropic
nonsense into consciously competent syntropic participation in
class one's eternally intertransforming evolution in support of
the integrity of cosmic scenario - Universe's eternal regeneration.
(246)</P>

<P>Prognostication is often a subjective science - it anticipates
what is going to happen to us. Navigation and ballistics are always
objective sciences, for they make possible prognostication of
what will happen if we employ the full family of mathematically
integratable factors governing local systemic intertransformabilities,
as permitted by the generalized principles, which always provide
six alternative moves with every turn to play in &quot;the game
of Universe.&quot; These permitted six moves for each turn to
play are the six edges of the tetrahedral system and are clearly
explained in Synergetics, vol. 2, &sect;537.40. (246, 247)</P>

<P>Class-one evolution has succeeded in ever increasing the range,
frequency, and safe velocity of human travel, exploration, and
information growth. Further, humans have developed environment-controlling
vehicles and local environment-controlling habitats that permit
their survival under conditions uncopable-with prior to the technological
evolution. All these are resultant upon human mind's being given
access to the generalized principles governing the design of the
successfully operating, eternally regenerative, scenario Universe.
(247)</P>

<P>The space programs entered into by the Russians and the Americans,
because of the military implications of possible containment of
one by the other, were class-two evolutionary events; however,
they opened the possibility for humanity to participate consciously
in class-one evolution's continual increase in the range, speed,
and frequency of humanity's travel and information-gathering in
local Universe as well as its participation in ever-more local
problem-solving within the ever-greater ranges of Universe thus
reached.(247)</P>

<P>The space program integrated the sciences of navigation, ballistics,
astrophysics, metallurgy, chemistry, and bio-anthropology. Bio-anthropology
is the positive class-one evolution's anticipatorily undertaken
improvement of both subjective and objective, energetic, environmentally
controllable events in order to keep already-healthy life even
healthier, whether in safely penetrating environments theretofore
lethally hostile to human life or in just improving the chances
for the healthiest to continue their optimum health or in multiplying
the numbers of humans who enjoy optimum healthworking eventually
toward avoiding any humans ever losing their optimum health. (247)</P>

<P>Bio-anthropology is class-one evolution's takeover and expansion
of class-two evolution's medicine, which copes essentially only
with humans who have lost their good health. (247)</P>

<P>The space program, as an integration of the plurality of projective-objective
sciences, called for the employment of what is known as the &quot;critical
path&quot; as the comprehensive design science's individual parts
production, subassembly, general assembly, progressive full assembly
testings, and launch scheduling. (247)</P>

<P>A critical path develops an exhaustive list of all that has
to be accomplished in order to arrive successfully at a given
objective theretofore never reached. The Apollo Project was the
official name of the undertaking that was to ferry humans over
to and land them on the Moon and return them safely to mother-Spaceship
Earth. (248)</P>

<P>The critical-path organization of the Apollo Project disclosed
some two million tasks that had to be successfully accomplished
before the human astronauts were to be returned safely to Spaceship
Earth. NASA's Apollo management then put a scientifically and
technically competent control group to work to identify all the
approximately two million tasks, a million of which required technological
performances the design, production, and successful operation
of which had never before been undertaken by humans. (248)</P>

<P>In this book we have set down our prehistory, our techno-social
history of &quot;Humans in Universe,&quot; and then in the &quot;Legally
Piggily&quot; chapter we have chronicled the overall pattern of
class-two evolutionary events that have, during the last half-
century, gone critical - bringing humanity to a moment of crisis
adequate in magnitude to springboard humanity into oblivion or
into a relatively utopian future. (248)</P>

<P>Because automobiles were becoming ever-more popular in the
1920s and because they were using inherently exhaustible fossil
fuels, such an approaching critical moment in human history as
we are now experiencing was clearly visible to me and many others
a half-century ago. I did not, however, know of any other humans
who thought there was anything that they personally could do about
this problem and any other such &quot;too big&quot; problems.
Nonetheless, I committed my life to dealing only with total Spaceship
Earth and all its passengers' regeneration. I have therefore included
the chapter on the self-disciplines I adopted at thirty-two years
of age at the 1927 outset (or soon thereafter) of my lifetime
commitment. These disciplines were adopted in view of the physical
magnitude and the metaphysical integrity involved in the balance-of-my-life
commitment. Many of the disciplines are importantly relevant today
in respect to the way in which unknown, economically insecure,
individual humans may function effectively in this world crisis.
(248)</P>

<P>Soon after 1927 I developed the World Game as an especially
important integration of the complex of self-adopted disciplines
and tasks I found myself progressively adopting as the years passed
and as my inventory of discovered errors and lessons thereby learned
multiplied. Our chapters on the Geoscope and the World Game provide
important frames of reference in the formulation of a critical-path
chart of what humanity must accomplish within a decade - or probably
perish. (248)</P>

<P>This last section of the book focuses on the critical path
itself and constitutes my own single human being's inherently
limited, 1927-and-thereafter, anticipatory formulations of the
order of absolutely essential tasks to be successfully accomplished
between 1927 and crossing of the epochal threshold into happy
continuance of all humans in Universe. Others can and will vastly
improve upon my critical path. What is now needed, however, is
an &quot;icebreaker&quot; critical-path submission. Here it is,
in the order of my spontaneous formulations of it. (248, 249)</P>

<P>In presenting it I need first to develop, if possible, some
powerfully integrating generalizations of already-introduced concepts.
For instance, we have developed the earlier concept of a system
as dividing all the Universe into all the Universe outside the
system - the presently tuned-out, irrelevant macrocosm - all the
Universe inside the system - the presently untuned-in, irrelevant
microcosm - and all the small remainder of the present, individually
tuned-in Universe of which the Universe-dividing system consists,
together with all of its presently integrated, common knowledge
of tuned-in, omnirelevant considerations. Systems scientifically
describe conceptual ramifications of thoughts and ideas. This
omnicosmic, four-dimensional, geometrical conception of a system
is a scientific generalization (see &quot;System-400.00&quot;
in Synergetics, vols. 1 and 2). (249)</P>

<P>Human organisms are systems. They are complex but very important
systems of energetically operative, integral tools. Some of them
are internally operative in manufacturing, maintaining, repairing,
and replacing the whole inventory of specialized interior as well
as generalized exterior tools. All of the integral exterior tools
such as the human hand and eyes have highly generalized but circumstantially
limited capabilities - for instance, they cannot work nakedly
above or below a very small temperature range, but within their
temperature limits their uses are myriad. (249)</P>

<P>Human mind, discovering principles, devises special case, less
frequently employed, nonintegral, from-self-detached, craft tools.
In due course human mind, discovering more principles, uses the
organically integral tools to operate the simple, detached craft
tools such as the stone hammer and knife, to produce much more
effective generalized industrial tools, such as a blacksmith's
forge and anvil, metal hammers and tongs, with which the smith
in turn produces even more specialized tools, such as metal horseshoes
and forged metal carpenter's hammers, to outperform wooden mallets
and stone hammers. Human mind, stimulated by the succession of
experiences attendant upon hitching an ox, a water buffalo, a
camel, or an elephant to an earth-working tool, came to the discovery
of the windmill and the waterwheel, and then coupled the windmill
or waterwheel with a grain-grinding stone milling wheel; then
in time conceived of the principle of using energy other than
human muscle to operate a class of tools known as the machine
tools, consisting of lathes, drill presses, metal planers, milling
machines, grinding machines, shapers, slotters, etc. Each such
machine tool performs in far finer, more powerful degree the metallic-substance-forming
and surface-finishing functions initially performed in principle
but under much more limited conditions only by the human hands
and other of the integral organic exterior tools. (249, 250)</P>

<P>All of the foregoing involves energy as work and as matter
and a complex of energy interexchanging. All such complex internal
and external energy intertransforming and exchanging can be spoken
of as interior and exterior metabolics. We are gradually working
toward a complex integration of many of our already-introduced
complex concepts into a generalization of interior and exterior
ballistics, which as energy intertransforming and exchanging can
be spoken of as interior and exterior metabolics. (250)</P>

<P>How apt a name for the human organism is &quot;an interior
and exterior metabolic system.&quot; We find that in these interior
and exterior metabolic systems, the interior tooling is highly
generalized, while the exterior tools are highly specialized and
able to cope with many variables, but that the data regarding
the different toolings vary hardly at all, which is to say that
the more nearly generalized the system, the less variable the
inventory of its constituents, wherefore the great scientific
generalizations are eternal and never vary. We find in the succession
of naval science and arts that the navy yard machine tools varied
hardly at all, being improved upon only slowly, and that the number-two
science and art of designing fleets and ships and their integral
interior ballistics varied more frequently than did the design
of the navy yard machine tools, whereas the exterior ballistics
and navigation dealt with swiftly changing sea and weather conditions,
though the navigational mathematics of spherical trigonometry
itself consisted of eternally invariant generalized principles.
We find our concept of industrialization to be an exterior-to-humans
metabolic system. (250)</P>

<P>We find our critical path to consist of a succession of omnirelevant,
frequently varying, widely ranging, highly specialized exterior
metabolic systems, being operated by humans, which humans themselves
are limited-range, rarely variant, interior and exterior metabolic
systems. (250)</P>

<P>A. In the &quot;Self-Disciplines&quot; chapter of this book,
I recounted that the larger the number of humans I undertook to
serve, the more effective I became, wherefore I concluded that
if I committed myself to serving everyone, I would be optimally
effective. (250)</P>

<P>B. I find the foregoing (A) to be sociologically akin to the
hard-science fact that astronomy and astrophysics - dealing in
total-known-Universe - enjoy humanity's farthest-ahead-in-time,
reliable prognosticating record by a reliably proven prognosticated-events-margin
of hundreds of years. (250, 251)</P>

<P>C. There seems to be a scientific generalization at work here
that relates intimately to the phenomena synergy-behavior of whole
systems unpredicted by the behavior or integral characteristics
of any parts of the system when the parts are considered only
separately. What is inferred here is that a competitive employment
of the whole family of generalized principles employed to serve
the successful human functioning in Universe renders one maximally
effective. (251)</P>

<P>All scientific generalizations are synergetic - that is, they
describe scientifically discovered interrelationships of system
parts that vary in respect to one another at only mathematically
describable different rates of change, which interrelationships
are in no way suggested by separate inspection of any one part
of the system. (251)</P>

<P>D. The generalization discovered to be commonly operative in
the foregoing paragraphs A, B, and C says, &quot;To be optimall
effective, under-take at outset the most comprehensive task in
the most comprehensive and incisively detailed manner.&quot; (251)</P>

<P>In undertaking our critical-path development of a practically
realizable means of bringing about all humanity's spontaneously
realizable escape from fearfully ignorant self-destruction-and
entrance into a design-science- artifacts- produced-and-induced,
sustainable, and unprecedentedly high standard of living for all,
to be accomplished within a generation - we are being taught by
the foregoing paragraphs A, B, C, D, to immediately &quot;undertake
the greatest task with thorough commitment of attention to every
detail.&quot; (251)</P>

<P>We are being taught by all the foregoing to assume as closely
as possible the viewpoint, the patience, and the competence of
God.(251)<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->
