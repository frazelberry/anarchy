<H3><A NAME="anchor17571"></A><FONT SIZE="+2">Twilight of the
World's Power Structures</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">HUMANITY IS MOVING EVER DEEPER
into crisis-a crisis without precedent.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">First, it is a crisis brought
about by cosmic evolution irrevocably intent upon completely transforming
omni- disintegrated humanity from a complex of around-the-world,
remotely-deployed-from-one-another, differently colored, differently
credoed, differently cultured, differently communicating and differently
competing entities into a completely integrated, comprehensively
interconsiderate, harmonious whole.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Second, we are in an unprecedented
crisis because cosmic evolution is also irrevocably intent upon
making omni-integrated humanity omnisuccessful, able to live sustainingly
at an unprecedentedly higher standard of living for all Earthians
than has ever been expenenced by any; able to live entirely within
its cosmic-energy income instead of spending its cosmic-energy
savings account (i.e., the fossil fuels) or spending its cosmic-
capital plant and equipment account (i.e., atomic energy) - the
atoms with which our Spaceship Earth and its biosphere are structured
and equipped - a spending folly no less illogical than burning
your house-and-home to keep the family warm on an unprecedentedly
cold midwinter night.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Humanity's cosmic-energy income
account consists entirely of our gravity- and star (99 percent
sun) - distributed cosmic dividends of waterpower, tidal power,
wavepower, windpower, vegetation-produced alcohols, methane gas,
vulcanism, and so on. Humanity's present rate of total energy
consumption amounts to only one four-millionth of one percent
of the rate of its energy income. Tax-hungry government and profit-hungry
business, for the moment, find it insurmountably difficult to
arrange to put meters between humanity and its cosmic-energy income,
and thus they do nothing realistic to help humanity enjoy its
fabulous energy-income wealth - in fact, they send their government
&quot;revenooers&quot; out into the mountain forest to fine and
to destroy the equipment of any civilian so &quot;treacherous&quot;
as to apply private enterprise in the alcohol-from-Sun-energy-photosynthesis
harvesting to personal advantaging. If any citizens start making
their own automobile-powering alcohol, the &quot;revenooers&quot;
will have to pounce on them just as they do on those making moonshine
&quot;likker.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Ninety-nine percent of humanity
does not know that we have the option to &quot;make it&quot; economically
on this planet and in the Universe. We do. It can only be accomplished,
however, through a design science initiative and technological
revolution.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">For three-quarters of all
the trillions of nights humans have been on board planet Earth,
the Moon has been their most intimate sky companion. For millions
of years humans assumed it to be obvious that no one would really
touch the Moon. Those who did not assume that to be obvious were
obviously loony-lunatics, &quot;Moon touchers.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In the battle of human power
systems to see who is to control the world's people and their
economies, the communist U.S.S.R. and the capitalist U.S.A. had
been taught by World War II that whoever could fly the highest
would gain the observational advantage for controlling the firepower
of their guns and thus win the military supremacy of the world.
In the &quot;cold&quot; Third World War the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A.,
inspired by the German rocketry, saw that whoever could maintain
the greatest number of around-the- world- outer- space- platforms
could control around- the- Earth firepower. The Moon was just
such a &quot;permanent&quot; sky advantage.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Greatly challenged by the
Russians' initially most successful space-operating accomplishments,
President John Kennedy authorized the funds for the Apollo Project,
which had first to do all of the tasks here on Earth preparatory
to getting a team of humans ferried over to the Moon, to land,
and then to return safely to Earth.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">There were obvious first things
first to be accomplished-second things before third things and
7308 things before 7309 things. Some were going to take longer
than others. There would be a pattern of start-ups and lead-ins
of differing time lengths. This complex, shad-bone-like pattern
would be known as &quot;the critical path.&quot; The critical
path of overall human history's technological evolution involved
two million (this is only a magnitude figure. It obviously is
not exact.) things that had to be done before blast-off of the
first Earth- to- Moon ferrying-over-and-back.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Fortunately, early humans,
having no knowledge that what they were doing would someday lead
to humans physically, safely visiting the Moon, had already accomplished
one million of those essential tasks before President John Kennedy
allocated the federal funds to accomplish the remaining one million.
Suddenly it was evident - but only to those few students who cared
about the overall significance of such nonobvious, vast-time-scale
inventories of evolutionary, historical, technological accomplishments
- that without the million items already accomplished, it would
be impossible to realize any of the Apollo Project's one million
additional technical requirements - let alone accomplish them
within the critically &quot;effective&quot; U.S.A. vs. U.S.S.R.
competition time limit. Evolution is methodically synergetic and
omnimeaningful.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Now, in 1980, a large number
of all humans ten years of age and under, all of whom were bom
after humans reached the Moon, have learned so much about the
Apollo Project as to be quite familiar with its critical-path
accomplishment. They have entered the evolutionary scenario at
a spontaneous conceptual level twice as well informed initially
as were any preApollo Project humans, and they find it logical
to think about the solution of major evolutionary challenges in
the comprehensive terms of both the all-history critical-path
lessons as well as those of the as-yet-clearly-remembered and
-documented special-case lessons of the Apollo Project's one million
additionally accomplished, critical-path tasks. The under-ten-yearold
post-Moon-landers are saying, &quot;Humans can do anything they
need to do.&quot; They are writing me letters saying so and asking
why we don't make our world work satisfactorily for all humans.
This is encouraging.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">By 1989 those successful Moon-ferry-over
conditioned, thoughtful young ones will be twenty. That's just
the right age for commanding and executing the 1989 world-embracing
design science revolution, which will result in the conversion
of all humanity into an integrated, omniharmonious, economically
successful, one-world family.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">As of 1980 the successful
solution of the myriad of social-economicpsychological problems
now existent is obviously a more difficult task for humanity to
address than was the achieving of the Apollo Project. For those
who care to know how we're going to accomplish the 1989 omnisuccess
of humans on Spaceship Earth, it is necessary to invest the rest
of this hour in reading this Introduction, which contains the
minimum information leading to ultimate comprehension of the fact
that humanity now - for the first time in history-has the realistic
opportunity to help evolution do what it is inexorably intent
on doing - converting all humanity into one harmonious world family
and making that family sustainingly, economically successful.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">It will take all the evenings
of one week to read the Critical Path book itself. This is the
minimum time investment necessary to discover what roles may be
effectively performed by humans individually in support of the
1989 design science realization of the success of humanity.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">History shows that, only when
the leaders of the world's great power structures have become
convinced that their power structures are in danger of being destroyed,
have the gargantuanly large, adequate funds been appropriated
for accomplishing the necessary epoch-opening new technologies.
It took preparation for World War III to make available the funds
that have given us computers, transistors, rockets, and satellites
to realistically explore the Universe. In the one hour of concentrated
introductory reading about the critical path that must be accomplished
in order to achieve understanding that we have the option to &quot;make
it,&quot; the first thing first is to understand what the world
power structures are and of what their unique technical levers
and strategies consist.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Throughout the history of
land and sea transport those who have gained and held control
of the world's lines of vital supply have done so only by becoming
the masters in the game of establishing supreme human power over
all other subpowerful organizations - ergo, invisibly over all
humanity.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The historical development
of massively keeled and ribbed, deep-bellied ships, which came
into human use in the 3000-1000 B.c. era of the Phoenicians, Cretans,
and Mycenaeans, altogether altered and vastly enlarged the interregional
and international physical-transporting means of the world's lines
of supply. The change was the shift over from that of the armed-horsemen-escorted,
way-station-fortressed, twixt-city-states, overland, mule-horse-and-camel-borne
caravaning to the thousandfold-greater cargo- and armaments-carrying
capacity of the fighting-crew-manned fleets of those massively
built, wind-sailing and slave-rowed, seagoing ships.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Ancient Troy was a powerful
city-state and commanded much of the overland traffic between
Asia and Europe. The Mycenaeans' siege of Troy - when their supplies
were continually replenished by their fleet of those heavily ribbed,
deep-bellied ships-reversed the city-state's former supremacy
over invaders, whose brought-with-them food had theretofore become
exhausted long before exhaustion of the food supplies stored in
the great granaries of those inside the walls. The fall of Troy
saw the supremacy over human affairs pass from the masters of
the overland, Asia-to-Europe, inland-sea ferrying and caravaning
lines of supply to the masters of the high-seas, maritime lines
of supply.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The center of the stage of
history's most critical events moved ever westward and mildly
northward. Thus unfortified Venice became in due course the headquarters
of the masters of the Mediterranean lines of supply.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The fifteenth-century Europeans'
adoption of Arabic numerals and their computation-facilitating
&quot;positioning-of-numbers&quot; altogether made possible Columbus's
navigational calculations and Copenicus's discovery of the operational
patterning of the solar system and its planets. Facile calculation
so improved both the building of the ships and their navigation
that the ever-larger ships of the Mediterranean ventured out into
the North and South Atlantic to round Africa and reach the Orient.
With Magellan's crew's completion of his planned circumnavigation,
the planet Earth's predominantly water- covered sphericity was
proven. The struggle for supreme mastery of human affairs thus
passed out of the Mediterranean and into the world's oceans. Ships
could carry vastly greater cargoes of the fabulous riches of the
Orient to the European market than could the overland caravaning.
One European ship completing one successful round trip to the
Orient could realize a great fortune for its owners.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In 1600 Queen Elizabeth I
and a few intimates founded the East India Company. Exercising
her crown privileges, the queen granted the company limited liability
for losses on the part of the enterprise backers. They could lose
their money if the ship were lost, but they could not be held
liable for the lives of the sailors who were drowned. While the
owners could insure and very greatly limit the magnitude of their
losses, the sailors and their families could not. &quot;Ltd.&quot;
- limited, in England - and &quot;Inc.&quot; - incorporated, in
the U.S.A. - and other similar legal definitions in all capitalist
countries constitute &quot;for ages uncontested&quot; - ergo,
custom-validated and legal-judgments-upheld-royal decrees greatly
favoring big-money capitalism over the mortal, breadwinner-loss-taking
vast majority of the poor.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Elizabeth's East India Company
scheme was to have her national navy (and armies) first win mastery
of the world's sea-lanes. This advantage would thereafter be exploited
by her privately owned enterprise. This scheme became one of the
first of such national power structure bids for establishing and
maintaining world-trade supremacy through dominance of the world's
high seas', ocean currents', trade winds', critical straits',
and only-seasonably-favorable passages' world-around line of vital
and desirable supplies. All the other world-power-stature individuals
who vied for supreme mastery of the world's high seas lines of
supply also operated invisibly through monarchs and nations over
whom they had sufficient influence. Through such behind-the-throne
influence the influenced nation's resources could be politically
maneuvered into paying for the building and operation of the navies
and armies that would seek to establish and protect their respective
privately owned enterprises.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">With the Battle of Trafalgar
in 1805 the British Empire won &quot;the world's power structures
championship&quot; and became historically the first empire &quot;
upon which,&quot; it was said, &quot;the sun never sets.&quot;
This is because it was the first empire in history to embrace
the entire spherical planet Earth's 71 -percent maritime, 29-percent
landed, wealth-producing activities. All previous empires - Genghis
Khan's, Alexander the Great's, the Romans', et al.were unified
European, North African, and Asian - continental, river-, lake-,
and sea-embracing, flat-out land areas completely surrounded in
all lateral directions by the infinitely unknown. All earlier
empires were infinite systems - open systems. The British Empire
was history's first spherically closed, finite system. Building
and maintaining the world's most powerful navy, the 1805 supremely
victorious British Empire was to maintain its sovereignty over
the world's oceans and seas for 113 years.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Concurrently with its 1600
A.D.- initiated two centuries of maritime and military struggle
for world dominance, England was also developing a civilian army
of the world's best-informed and Empire-backed scientific, economic,
and managerial personnel for the most economically profitable
realization of its grand, world-embracing strategies. To educate
the army of civil servants was the responsibility of the East
India Company College located just outside of London. (In 1980
it is as yet operating.) Its graduates went to all known parts
of the planet to gather all possible data on the physical and
human culture resources to be exploited as well as information
on the local customs of all the countries, large and small, with
whom Great Britain and the East India Company must successfully
cope and trade.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0"></FONT><A NAME="anchor52649"></A><FONT
 COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In 1800 Thomas Malthus, later professor
of political economics of the East India Company College, was
the first human in history to receive a comprehensively complete
inventory of the world's vital and economic statistics. The accuracy
of the pre-Trafalgar 1800 inventory was verified by a similar
world inv<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->entory taken by the
East India Company in 1810. In a later-post-Trafalgar-book Malthus
confirmed in 1810 his 1800 finding that world-around humanity
was increasing its numbers at a geometrical progression rate while
increasing its life-support production at only an arithmetical
progression rate, ergo, an increasing majority of humans would
have to live out their short years in want and misery.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">&quot;Pray all you want,&quot;
said Malthus, &quot;it will do you no good. There is no more!&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">A half-century later Darwin
expounded his theory of evolution, assuming that nature's inexorable
processes were the consequence of the &quot;survival only of the
fittest species and individuals within those species.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Karl Marx compounded Malthus's
and Darwin's scientifically convincing conclusions and said, in
effect, &quot;The worker is obviously the fittest to survive.
He is the one who knows how to handle the tools and seeds to produce
the life support. The opulent others are 'parasites.&quot;' The
opulent others said, &quot;We are opulent and on top of the heap
because we demonstrate Darwin's 'fittest to survive.' The workers
are dull and visionless. What is needed in this world is big-thinking
enterprise, courage, cunning, and fighting skill.&quot; For the
last century these two ideologies, communism and free enterprise,
have dominated the political affairs of world-around humanity.
Each side says, &quot;You may not like our system, but we are
convinced that we have the fittest, fairest, most ingenious way
of coping with the lethal inadequacy of life support operative
on our planet, but because there are those who disagree diametrically
on how to cope, only all-out war can resolve which system is fittest
to survive.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Those in supreme power politically
and economically as of 1980 are as yet convinced that our planet
Earth has nowhere nearly enough life support for all humanity.
All books on economics have only one basic tenet - the fundamental
scarcity of life support. The supreme political and economic powers
as yet assume that it has to be either you or me. Not enough for
both. That is why (1) those in financial advantage fortify themselves
even further, reasoning that unselfishness is suicidal. That is
why (2) the annual military expenditures by the U.S.S.R., representing
socialism, and the U.S.A., representing private enterprise, have
averaged over $200 billion a year for the last thirty years, doubling
it last year to $400 billion-making a thus-far total of six trillion,
400 billion dollars spent in developing the ability to kill ever-more
people, at ever-greater distances, in ever-shorter time.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Weighing only fifty-five pounds,
with a wingspan of ninety-six feet, the human-powered Gossamer
Albatross was able to fly across the English Channel because the
structural materials of which it was built were many times tensilely
stronger than an equal weight of the highest-strength aircraft
aluminum. The tensile strengths of the Albatross's structural
materials were sixty times stronger per equivalent weight than
the strongest structural materials available to Leonardo da Vinci
for realizing the design of his proposed human-powered flying
machine. The Albatross's high-strength carbon-fiber and Mylar
materials were all developed only a short time agosince World
War II.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">A one-quarter-ton communication
satellite is now outperforming the previously used 175,000 tons
of transatlantic copper cables, with this 700,000-fold reduction
in system-equipment weight providing greater message-carrying
capacity and transmission fidelity, as well as using vastly fewer
kilowatts of operational energy.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Continuing to attempt to fit
our late-twentieth-century astronautical man-on-Moon-visiting
capability into a nineteenth- century horse- and- buggy street
pattern, house-to-house-yoo-hooing life-style (and a land baron
racket) is so inefficient that the overall design of humanity's
present social, economic, and political structuring and the physical
technology it uses wastes ninety-five out of every 100 units of
the energy it consumes. (Our automobiles' reciprocating engines
are only 15-percent efficient, whereas turbines are 30 percent,
jet engines 60 percent, and fuel cells used by astronauts 80 percent.)
In the United States, throughout all twenty-four hours of every
day of the year-year after year - we have an average of two million
automobiles standing in front of red stoplights with their engines
going, the energy for which amounts to that generated by the full
efforts of 200 million horses being completely wasted as they
jump up and down going nowhere.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Environment-controlling buildings
gain or lose their energy as &quot;heat or cool&quot; only through
their containing surfaces. Spheres contain the most volume with
the least surface - i.e., have the least possible surface-to-volume
ratio. Every time we double the diameter of a spherical structure,
we increase its contained atmosphere eightfold and its enclosing
surface only fourfold. When doubling the diameter of our sphere,
we are not changing the size of the contained molecules of atmosphere.
Therefore, every time we double a spherical structure's diameter,
we halve the amount of enclosing surface through which an interior
molecule of atmosphere can gain or lose energy as &quot;heat or
cool.&quot; Flat slabs have a high surface-to-volume ratio, and
so flat slab fins make good air-cooling motorcycle and light-airplane
engines. Tubes have the highest surface-to-volume ratios. Triangular-
or square-sectioned tubes have higher surface-to-volume ratios
than have round-sectioned tubes. Tall slab buildings and vertical,
square-sectioned, tubular-tower skyscrapers have the maximum possible
energy (as heat or cool)- losing capability.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">One two-mile-diameter dome
enclosing all the mid-Manhattan buildings between Twenty-second
and Sixty-second streets and between the Hudson and East rivers,
having a surface that is only one eighty-fourth that of all the
buildings now standing in that midtown area, would reduce the
heating and cooling energy requirements of that area eighty-four-fold.
The human pedal-powered airplane and the communication satellite
are only two out of hundreds of thousands of instances that can
now be cited of the accomplishment of much greater performance
with much less material. The inefficiency of automobiles' reciprocating
engines - and their traffic-system-wasted fuel - and the energy
inefficiency of today's buildings, are only two of hundreds of
thousands of instances that can be cited of the design-avoidable
energy wastage. But the technical raison d'etre for either the
energy-effectiveness gains or losses is all completely invisible
to human eyes. Thus, the significance of their omni-integratable
potentialities is uncomprehended by either the world's leaders
or the led.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Neither the great political
and financial power structures of the world, nor the specialization-blinded
professionals, nor the population in general realize that sum-totally
the omni-engineering-integratable, invisible revolution in the
metallurgical, chemical, and electronic arts now makes it possible
to do so much more with ever fewer pounds and volumes of material,
ergs of energy, and seconds of time per given technological function
that it is now highly feasible to take care of everybody on Earth
at a &quot;higher standard of living than any have ever known.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">It no longer has to be you
or me. Selfishness is unnecessary and henceforth unrationalizable
as mandated by survival. War is obsolete.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">It could never have been done
before. Only ten years ago the more- with- less technology reached
the point where it could be done. Since then the invisible technological-capability
revolution has made it ever easier so to do. It is, a matter of
converting the high technology from weaponry to livingry. The
essence of livingry is human-life advantaging and environment
controlling. With the highest aeronautical and engineering facilities
of the world redirected from weaponry to livingry production,
all humanity would have the option of becoming enduringly successful.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">All previous revolutions have
been political - in them the have-not majority has attempted revengefully
to pull down the economically advantaged minority. If realized,
this historically greatest design revolution will joyously elevate
all humanity to unprecedented heights.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The architectural profession
- civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical - has always been
the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding
livingry, as opposed to weaponry. Now is the time for the comprehensive
architectural profession to reorient itself from the six-months-per-one-residence
work schedule to the millions-per-day, air-deliverable, sewer-and-water-mains-emancipated,
energy-harvesting, dwellingmachine-production world with its unpurchasable,
air-deliverable dwelling machines only rentable from a Hertz-Hilton-Bell-Tel
service industry, able to accommodate at unprecedentedly high
standards of living all humanity's remote-from-one-another living
accommodations. Now is also the time for the architectural profession
to reorient itself from the years-to-build, human-need-exploiting
cities to the all-in-one-day-air-deliverable-or-removable, human-need-serving,
singly-domed-over cities. We have to satisfacto&not; rily rehouse
the alternately convergent and divergent shuttling phases of four
billion uprooting, around- the- world- integrating, sometimes
transient, sometimes resident, sometimes in cities, sometimes
in the country humans - before 2000 A.D.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Technologically we now have
four billion billionaires on board Spaceship Earth who are entirely
unaware of their good fortune. Unbeknownst to them their legacy
is being held in probate by general ignorance, fear, selfishness,

laws and the like, as bureaucratically maintained by the incumbent
power structures.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Dismaying as all this paralysis
may be, it will lead eventually to such crisis that comprehensive
dissemination of the foregoing truths ultimately will be accomplished
through (1) the world-around-integrated electronic media broadcasting
and (2) the computerized switchover from the inherently-inadequate-life-support
accounting assumption of yesterday to the adequatefor-everyone-and-everything,
time-energy accounting comprehensively employed by the multibillion-galaxied,
eternally regenerative Universe itself. An exclusively-to-be-accomplished,
world-around-integrated, computerfacilitated, cosmically compatible
accounti - ng switchover, will make it popularly comprehensible
that we do indeed have four billion billionaires on our planet,
thereby publicizing that fact and thereby inducing the systematic
release of their heritage to all Earthian humans. All this accounting
switchover must also be accomplished before 2000 A.D.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Those who make money with
money deliberately keep it scarce. Money is not wealth. Wealth
is the accomplished technological ability to protect, nurture,

an expediency-adopted means of inter- exchanging disparately sized,
nonequatable items of real wealth.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">A shoemaker has ten milk-drinking
children. He wants to acquire a milk cow to convert grass into
milk to take care of his children. The shoemaker makes his shoes
out of cowhide, but that is not the reason he wants the cow. If
and when the cow gets too old for milk production, he can butcher
it for its meat and obtain a goodly supply of cowhide for his
shoemaking.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">A cow breeder wants a pair
of shoes. He and the shoemaker agree that it takes much more time
and individual inputs to produce a milk cow than it does to make
a pair of shoes. They agree that you can't cut the cow up and
still milk it. So they employ metal, which, being scarce and physically
useful, has high and known exchange value and which could be cut
apart into whatever fractions are necessary to implement the disparate
values of interexchanging. That's how we got money.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Computers do not have to see
or feel anything. Computers do not deal in opinion judgments;
they simply store, retrieve, and integrate all the information
given them. The more relevant the information they are given and
the more accurate that information, the better the answers that
the computer can give as to the consequences of doing thus and
so under a given set of circumstances. Only the computer can cope
with the astronomical complexity of integrating the unpredicted
potentials of the millions of invisible technology gains in physical
capabilities already accomplished. Only world- considerate- computer
accounting will be able to produce the figures that will persuade
all humanity to divert high-science technology from weaponry to
livingry. Computer capability will clearly manifest that we indeed

all the production starts and holds on world-wide coordinated
supplying of the needs of a world-around dynamically dwelling
humanity. Computers will relegate all gold to its exclusively
functional uses as a supreme electromagnetic conduction-and-reflection
medium-with its supremacy amongst metals also manifest as rated
in weight and bulk per accomplished function. The computer will
relegate all physical substances to their uniquely best functional
uses.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">All the foregoing considerations
demonstrate clearly why the computer accounting switchover is
not only possible but mandatory and must be accomplished before
the fear and ignorance of the billions of humans involved in the
power structure's bureaucracies panic and push the atomic-bomb
release buttons. What makes us say &quot;panic&quot; of the major
political, religious, and business bureaucracies? Bureaucracies
will panic because all the great political, religious, and - most
of all - big-business systems would find their activities devastated
by the universal physical success of all humanity. All the strengths
of all great politics and religion and most of business are derived
from the promises they give of assuaging humanity's seemingly
tragic dilemma of existing in an unalterable state of fundamental
inadequacy of life support.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">There are two more prime obstacles
to all humanity's realization of its option to &quot;make it.&quot;
One is the fact that humanity does not understand the language
of science. Therefore it does not know that all that science has
ever found out is that the physical Universe consists entirely
of the most exquisitely interreciprocating technology. Ninety-nine
percent of humanity thinks technology is a &quot;new&quot; phenomenon.
The world populace identifies technology with (1) weapons and
(2) machines that compete with them for their jobs. Most people
therefore think they are against technology, not knowing that
the technology they don't understand is their only means of exercising
their option to &quot;make it&quot; on this planet and in this
life.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Fortunately the mathematical
coordinate system that has been and as yet is employed by science
is not the coordinate system employed by the physical Universe.
Nature is always most economical. Science's coordinate system
is not most economical and is therefore difficult. Nature never
has to stop to calculate before behaving in the most economical
manner. Scientists do. Also, fortunately, we have discovered nature's
coordinate system, which is elegantly simple and popularly comprehensible.
(See Synergetics, vols. 1 and 2 - Macmillan, 1975, 1979.) Synergetics
will make it possible for all humanity to comprehend that physical
Universe is technology and that the technology does make possible
all humanity's option to endure successfully.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The other prime obstacle to
realization of the &quot;great option&quot; is the fact that the
world's power structures have always &quot;divided to conquer&quot;
and have always &quot;kept divided to keep conquered.&quot; As
a consequence the power structure has so divided humanity - not
only into special function categories but into religious and language
and color categories - that individual humans are now helplessly
inarticulate in the face of the present crisis. They consider
their political representation to be completely corrupted, therefore
they feel almost utterly helpless.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Asking a computer &quot;What
shall I do?&quot; is useless. You can get an informative answer,
however, if you program your question into the computer as follows:
&quot;Under the following set of operative circumstances, each
having a positive or negative number value in an only-one-value
system, which of only two possible results will be obtained if
I do so and so? And by how much?&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In 1953 my friend the late
Walter Reuther, then president of the United Auto Workers, was
about to meet with the board of directors of General Motors to
form a new and timely post-World-War-II-oriented labor pact. At
that time the first of the &quot;new-scientists' -prototyped computers
ever to be industrially manufactured were being assembled, put
in running order, and fine-tuned by Walter Reuther's skilled machinists.
Walter had all his fine-tuning machinists put the following problem
into their computers: &quot;In view of the fact that most of General
Motors' workers are also its customers, if I demand of General
Motors that they grant an unheard-of wage advance plus unprecedented
vacation, health, and all conceivable lifetime benefits for all
of its workers, amounting sum-totally to so many dollars, which
way will General Motors make the most money: by granting or refusing?&quot;
All the computers said, &quot;General Motors will make the most
profit by granting.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Thus fortified, Walter Reuther
made his unprecedented demands on General Motors' directors, who
were elected to their position of authority only by the stockholders
and who were naturally concerned only with the welfare of those
stockholders. Reuther said to the assembled General Motors board
of directors: &quot;You are going to grant these demands, not
because you now favor labor (which, in fact, you consider to be
your enemy), but because by so granting, General Motors will make
vastly greater profits. If you will put the problem into your
new computers, you will learn that I am right.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The directors said, &quot;Hah-hah!
You obviously have used the wrong computers or have misstated
the problem to the computers.&quot; Soon, however, all their own
computers told the directors that Walter was right. They granted
his demands. Within three years General Motors was the first corporation
in history to net a billion-dollar profit after paying all government
taxes - with their profits increasing steadily thereafter for
twenty years.</FONT></H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In the electrical-power and
light-generating industry the privately owned &quot;public&quot;
utilities' largest customers are the industries. The public utilities
must always generate enough electricity to ensure their customers'
never having a shortage and that electricity be cheap; otherwise
the industrial customers would install their own generating equipment.
What the customers don't use of the surplus generated power is
pure loss to the &quot;public&quot; utilities. To cope efficiently
with the foregoing variables, each utility has plotted the peak
and valley patterns for each second of each day of all the years
since the &quot;public&quot; utilities entered the business. The
utilities have many stand-by generators, most of which are in
operation for only a small fraction of the time. All of each company's
past peak-and-valley history is combined with probability mathematics
to determine how many generators to have in operation at any given
time of any given day of each newly evolving year.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In the 1930s Wendell Willkie
was first to discover that with integration of the electrical-generating
networks of neighboring localities, whose peaks and valleys inherently
differ to some degree, the excess of any of the network's member
utilities at any one moment is frequently used by other grid members'
peaks. When this happens, it brings pure profit to the excess-power-generating
seller.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The practical limit on the
distance of electrical power delivery from the time of World War
I until twenty years ago was 350 miles. However, 350 miles could
not span the distances between any two of the continent's four
national time zones. Twenty years ago, as a consequence of the
new technologies of the space age, ultrahigh-voltage, superconductivity,
and other technical developments occurred that made 1500-mile
delivery of electricity possible, practical, and economical. This
reach provided the ability to span continental time zones, whose
peaks and valleys obviously differed greatly from one another,
and this meant greater profits to be derived from across-time-zone-integrated
electrical-energy networks. Responding to 1929's Great Crash,
the New Deal set up the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built
many huge dams and enormous hydroelectric-power-generating capability.
This solved all the flood problems of that area. It also greatly
irritated the &quot;private sector,&quot; which said government
had no right to enter into competition with &quot;private enterprise.&quot;
Subsequently the government set up its Rural Electrification Administration
(REA). The government was interested in rehabilitating the country's
Depression-ruined farms. The private sector's electrical-generating
industry was not interested. They thought it could be done only
at a great loss. The electrical grids financed and administered
by the REA interspersed all the great urban centers' electric
grids in the United States. When the 1500-mile electrical-delivery
reach unpredictably occurred and potential grid integratings across
the time zones loomed, the govemment-administered rural grids
became strategically involved. The boards of directors of all
the private-sector &quot;public&quot; utilities said they would
never integrate electrically with government-they were completely
against government being in their game. However, they obviously
could not integrate across the time zones except by employing
the govemment's Rural- Electrification- established- and- financed
grid.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The problem, with all its
pro and con data, was put into the computer by the engineers of
both the government and the private sector. The question was asked:
&quot;In which way would the private sector make the most money
- by integrating with the government's network, or not?&quot;
The computer said the private sector would make 30-percent greater
profit by integrating with government. The private sector undertook
to do so. When both sides found that great profit would occur
for the private sector - which for many years had been the prime
financial backer of the Republican party - great political barriers
developed in the Democratic administration which had to be overcome.
President Lyndon Johnson, acting on behalf of the federal government,
used his power over the Democratic party to remove enough barriers
to permit the government to agree to integrate with the private
sector. The &quot;private sector,&quot; which theretofore had
always backed the Republican presidential candidates, apparently
became confused and backed Democrat Lyndon Johnson's successful
bid for re-election.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Time and again in their short
history computers have demonstrated their ability to reverse historically
assumed- to- be- unalterable positions of both sides of the opposed
political/economic power structure's directorates or committees.
Computers can remember accurately and can cope with and integrate
the vast amounts of all known, relevant information on complex
problems, uncopeable-with prior to the computer. What we had prior
to the computer were respected opinions and only-selfishness-conditioned
reflexes on how to cope. Though an opinion might be wrong, there
was no practical and convincing way to prove it. Unchallenged,
the opinions became respected precedent, then exceptionless concepts,
and sometimes even civil and academically accepted social law.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Computers will be used more
and more to produce the opinion-obsoleting answers to progressive
crises-provoked questions about which way world society as a whole
will enduringly profit the most. Computers will correct misinformed
and disadvantaged conditioned reflexes, not only of the few officials
who have heretofore blocked comprehensive techno-economic and
political evolutionary advancement, but also of the vast majorities
of heretofore-ignorant total humanity.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Within the crises times immediately
ahead - into which we have already entered - the computer is soon
to respond: &quot;We must integrate the world's electrical-energy
networks.&quot; We must be able to continually integrate the progressive
night-into-day and day-into-night hemispheres of our revolving
planet. With all the world's electric energy needs being supplied
by a twenty-four-hour-around, omni-integrated network, all of
yesterday's, one-half-the-time-unemployed, standby generators
will be usable all the time, thus swiftly doubling the operating
capacity of the world's electrical energy grid.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">A half-century ago I discovered
with my nonvisibly distorted, one- world- island- in- one- world-
ocean, 90' longitude- meridian- backbone, north- south- oriented,
sky- ocean world map that a world energy network grid would be
possible if we could develop the delivery reach. Since I was on
the watch for it, when the 1500-mile-reach capability was technically
established twenty years ago, it was immediately evident to me
that we could carry our American electrical network grid across
the Bering Straits from our Alaska grid to reach the extreme northeastern
Russian grid, where the U.S.S.R. had completed a program of installing
dams and hydroelectric-power-generating stations on all their
northerly flowing rivers all the way into eastern Kamchatka. About
1500 miles could interconnect the Russians' Asiatic continent
electric integrated power grid with the Alaskan grid of the industrial
North American electric energy grid.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In the early years of Trudeau's
premiership of Canada, when he was about to make his first visit
to Russia, I gave him my world energy network grid plan, which
he presented to Brezhnev, who turned it over to his experts. On
his return to Canada Trudeau reported to me that the experts had
come back to Brezhnev with: &quot;feasible ... desirable.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">I therefore predict that before
the end of the 1980s the computer's politically unbiased problem-solving
prestige will have brought about the world's completely integrated
electrical-energy network grid. This world electric grid, with
its omni-integrated advantage, will deliver its electric energy
anywhere, to anyone, at any one time, at one common rate. This
will make possible a world-around uniform costing and pricing
system for all goods and services based realistically on the time-energy
metabolic accounting system of Universe.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In this cosmically uniform,
common energy-value system for all humanity, costing will be expressed
in kilowatt-hours, watt-hours, and wattseconds of work. Kilowatt-hours
will become the prime criteria of costing the production of the
complex of metabolic involvements per each function or item. These
uniform energy valuations will replace all the world's wildly
intervarying, opinion-gambled-upon, top-power-system-manipulatable
monetary systems. The time-energy world accounting system will
do away with all the inequities now occurring in regard to the
arbitrarily maneuverable international shipping of goods and the
top economic power structure's banker-invented, international
balance-of-trade accountings. It will eliminate all the tricky
banking and securities-markets exploitations of all the around-
the- world- time- zone activities differences in operation today,
all unbeknownst to the at-all-times two billion humans who are
sleeping.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The world energy network grid
will be responsible for the swift disappearance of planet Earth's
150 different nationalities. We now have 150 supreme admirals,
all trying to command the same ship to go in different directions,
with the result that the ship is going around in circles - getting
nowhere. The 150 nations act as 150 blood clots in blocking the
flow of recirculating metals and other traffic essential to realization
of the design science revolution.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">In treating with the many
immediate, most important survival problems, each question will
be programmed into the computer asking which way society will
experience the lowest-cost optimum living: by giving all humans
handsome fellowships, with an income adequate for a high standard
of living, or by having them go on earning their livings. The
computer will show that 70 percent of all jobs in America and
probably an equivalently high percentage of the jobs in other
Western private-enterprise countries are preoccupied with work
that is not producing any wealth or life support-in&not; spectors
of inspectors, reunderwriters of insurance reinsurers, Obnoxico
promoters, spies and counterspies, military personnel, gunmakers,
etc.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The computer will also have
verified both of the important findings of the brilliant Denver,
Colorado, oil geologist, Frangois de Chardenedes: (1) the script
of his scenario of &quot;Nature's Production of Petroleum,&quot;
and (2) his economic findings regarding the amount of energy employed
as heat and pressure, for the length of time initially that it
took nature to photosynthetically process Sun radiation into the
myriad of hydrocarbon molecules that comprise all the vegetation
and algae, which later are consumed and growthfully multiplied
by a myriad of other biological species, a large percentage of
which Sun-energy-nurtured-and-multiplied molecules are ultimately
processed into petroleum.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The script of de Chardenedes's
&quot;Scenario of Petroleum Production&quot; makes it clear that,
with all that cosmic-energy processing (as rain, wind, and gravitational
pressure) and processing time (paid for at the rates you and I
pay for household electrical energy), it costs nature well over
a million dollars to produce each gallon of petroleum. To say
&quot;I didn't know that&quot; doesn't alter the inexorable energy
accounting of eternally regenerative, 100-percent-efficient- ergo,
100-percent-concerned-physical-energy Universe.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">We find all the no-life-support-wealth-producing
people going to their 1980 jobs in their cars or buses, spending
trillions of dollars' worth of petroleum daily to get to their
no-wealth-producing jobs. It doesn't take a computer to tell you
that it will save both Universe and humanity trillions of dollars
a day to pay them handsomely to stay at home.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">History's political and economic
power structures have always fearfully abhorred &quot;idle people&quot;
as potential troublemakers. Yet nature never abhors seemingly
idle trees, grass, snails, coral reefs, and clouds in the sky.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">One would hope the at-home-staying
humans will start thinking-&quot;What was it I was thinking about
when they told me I had to &#145;earn my living' doing what someone
else had decided needed to be done? What do I see that needs to
be done that nobody else is attending to? What do I need to learn
to be effective in attending to it in a highly efficient and inoffensive-to-others
manner?&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Comprehensively and incisively
programmed with all the relevant data regarding education, it
will be evidenced that the physical and social costs will be far
less for individual, at-home-initiated, research-and-development-interned
self-teaching than having individual students going to schools,
being bused, and so on. This mass-production baby-sitting is only
continued because of the union-organized response to the fear
of the teachers about losing their jobs. Their political clout
has for long been strong enough to guarantee continuance of this
inefficiency to the present moment.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The computer will make it
clear that by far the most effective educational system for human
beings - all the way from birth through early childhood and on
- is that to be derived from the home video cassette system and
its supporting books, the pages of which are also to be called
forth on world- satellite- interlinked video &quot;library&quot;
screens as published in any language. The computer will also make
it very clear that, freed of the necessity to earn a living, all
humanity will want to exercise its fundamental drive first to
comprehend &quot;what it is all about&quot; and second to demonstrate
competence in respect to the challenges. The greatest privilege
in human affairs will be to be allowed to join any one of the
real wealth- production or maintenance teams.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Fortunately, the computer-directable

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">To know now what we could
never have known before 1969 - that we now have an option for
all humanity to &quot;make it&quot; successfully on this planet
in this lifetime - is not to be optimistic. It is only a validation
of hope, a hope that had no operationally foreseeable validity
before 1969. Whether it is to be Utopia or Oblivion will be a
touch-and-go relay race right up to the final moment. The race
is between a better-informed, hopefully inspired young world versus
a running-scared, misinformedly brain-conditioned, older world.
Humanity is in &quot;final exam&quot; as to whether or not it
qualifies for continuance in Universe as mind, with the latter's
access to the design laws called by science &quot;the generalized
principles&quot; - governing eternally regenerative Universe.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Human minds have a unique
cosmic function not identifiable with any other phenomenon - the
capability to act as local Universe information-harvesters and
local Universe problem-solvers in support of the integrity of
eternally regenerative Universe.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">At the present cosmic moment,
muscle, cunning, fear, and selfishness are in powerful control
of human affairs. We humans are here in Universe to exercise the
Universe-functioning of mind. Only mind can apprehend, abide by,
and be led by truth. If human mind comes into control of human
affairs, the first thing it will do is exercise our option to
&quot;make it.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">If you read the entire Critical
Path book carefully, including its sometimes long but essentially
detailed considerations, and pay realistically close attention
to these considerations, you will be able to throw your weight
into the balancing of humanity's fate. While you could be &quot;the
straw that breaks the camel's back,&quot; compressively you can
also be the &quot;straw&quot;-straw of intellect, initiative,
unselfishness, comprehensive integrity, competence, and love-whose
ephemerally effective tension saves us.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The invisibly tensive straws
that can save us are those of individual human integrities-in
daring to steer the individual's course only by truth, strange
as the realized truth may often seem-wherever and whenever the
truths are evidenced to the individual-wherever they may lead,
unfamiliar as the way may be.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The integrity of the individual's
enthusiasm for the now-possible success of all humanity is critical
to successful exercise of our option. Are you spontaneously enthusiastic
about everyone having everything you can have?</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">For only a short time, in
most countries, has the individual human had the right of trial
by jury. To make humanity's chances for a fair trial better, all
those testifying must swear &quot;to tell the truth, all the truth,
and nothing but the truth.&quot; But humans have learned scientifically
that the exact truth can never be attained or told. We can reduce
the degree of tolerated error, but we have learned physically,
as Heisenberg discovered, that exactitude is prohibited, because
most exquisite physical experiment has shown that &quot;the act
of measuring always alters that which is measured.&quot;</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">We can sense that only God
is the perfect - the exact truth. We can come ever nearer to God
by progressively eliminating residual errors. The nearest each
of us can come to God is by loving the truth. If we don't program
the computer truthfully with all the truth and nothing but the
truth, we won't get the answers that allow us to &quot;make it.&quot;
When we speak of the integrity of the individual, we speak of
that which life has taught the individual by direct experience.
We are not talking about loyalty to your mother, your friends,
your college fraternity, or your boss, who told you how to behave
or think. In speaking of truth we are not talking about the position
to take that seems to put you in the most favorable light.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">It was the 1927 realization
of the foregoing that brought the author to reorganize his life
to discover what, if anything, the little, penniless, unknown
individual, with dependent wife and child, might be able to do
effectively on behalf of all humanity that would be inherently
impossible for great nations or great corporate enterprises to
do. This occasioned what is described in my &quot;Self-Disciplines,&quot;
Chapter 4.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">With world-around contact
with youth, generated by invitations to speak to the students
of over 500 universities and colleges during the last half-century,
I can conclude at the outset of 1980 that the world public has
become disenchanted with both the political and financial leadership,
which it no longer trusts to solve the problems of historical
crisis. Furthermore, all the individuals of humanity are looking
for the answer to what the little individual can do that can't
be done by great nations and great enterprises.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The author thought that it
would be highly relevant to the purpose of this book to enumerate
those self-disciplines that he had adopted and used during those
fifty years. Only those self-disciplines can cogently explain
why he adopted the design science revolution and not the political
revolutions (the strategy of all history). Only by understanding
those disciplines can we understand the strategy governing the
development of the artifacts, which strategy is called &quot;critical
path&quot; - ergo, the name of this book.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Each year I receive and answer
many hundreds of unsolicited letters from youth anxious to know
what the little individual can do. One such letter from a young
man named Michael - who is ten years old-asks whether I am a &quot;doer
or a thinker.&quot; Although I never &quot;tell&quot; anyone what
to do, I feel it quite relevant at this point to quote my letter
to him explaining what I have been trying to do in the years since
my adoption of my 1927-inaugurated self-disciplinary resolves.
The letter, dated February 16, 1970, reads:</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Dear Michael,</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Thank you very much for your

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">The things to do are: the
things that need doing: that you see need to be done, and that
no one else seems to see need to be done. Then you will conceive
your own way of doing that which needs to be done - that no one
else has told you to do or how to do it. This will bring out the
real you that often gets buried inside a character that has acquired
a superficial array of behaviors induced or imposed by others
on the individual.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#ffff91" SIZE="+0">Try making experiments of
anything you conceive and are intensely interested in. Don't be
disappointed if something doesn't work. That is what you want
to know - the truth about everything - and then the truth about

integrity that they can work coherently despite non-working elements
embraced by their system.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">These money interests are wrong. Because of
(A) the constant increase in strength per pound of new metallic

electronics, in general we have the capability, which can be fully
realized within ten years, of producing and sustaining a higher
standard of living for all humanity than that ever heretofore
experienced or dreamt of by any. (198, 199)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">This is not an opinion or a hope-it is an

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">This will be an inherently sustainable physical
success for all humanity and all its generations to come. It can
be accomplished not only within ten years but with the phasing
out forever of all use of fossil fuels and atomic energy. Our
technological strategy makes it incontrovertible that we can live
luxuriously entirely on our daily Sun-radiation-and- gravity-produced
income energy. The quantity of physical, cosmic energy wealth
as radiation arriving aboard planet Earth each minute is greater
than all the energy used annually by all humanity. World Game
makes it eminently clear that we have four billion billionaires
aboard our planet, as accounted by real wealth, which fact is
obscured from public knowledge by the exclusively conceived and
operated money game and its monopolized credit system accounting.

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Wealth is, then, the already organized human
capability and know-how to employ the fixed, inanimate, planetary
assets and omni-cosmically operative and only celestially emanating
natural energy income in such a manner as to predictably cope
with so many forward days of so many human lives by providing
for their (1) protection, (2) comfort, and (3) nurturing, and
for (4) the accommodation of the ongoing development by humans
of their as-yet-untapped store of intellectual and aesthetic faculties,

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Quickly reviewing the earliest large-scale
wealth trading by humans, payments were made in &quot;kind&quot;
- that is, with livestock that could be driven from here to there.
Most valuable were cattle. When &quot;money,&quot; or heads of
cattle (known as capital, capita meaning &quot;head&quot; in Latin),
was loaned to enterprisers, the latter's cattle were held by the
lender as collateral until the enterprise venture was completed.
The interim birth and growth of calves into cattle became the
&quot;interest&quot; on the loan to be paid by the borrower to
the lender of the venture's working capital. Much later, metal
money replaced the cattle. The concept of interest due to the
loaner persisted, but since metal does not breed more metal, the
interest paid reduces the realwealth value of the collateral when
returned to the borrower. (201)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">As the scale of long-distance trading exceeded
the distances to which the cattle could be driven, the trading
shifted primarily into water-bome ships. Ships carry far greater
loads than can humans or beasts of burden. In the earliest days
of international trading by ships cattle were used as &quot;money.&#148;,
This became increasingly impractical, and the Phoenicians invented
iron money in the form of miniature bull horns. With metal as
money there swiftly developed a world-around preference for gold,
due to its scarcity and easily recognized weight per volume as
well as its nontarnishability. World-trading ships carrying gold
soon became prey to hijacking pirates. As mentioned in our &quot;Legally
Piggily&quot; chapter, when the British Empire came into world-around
and century-enduring supremacy in 1805, its administrators made
trade treaties with countries from every region of the world.
Thereafter both sides kept their trading on books of import-export
accounts that were balanced annually, and the debtor nation paid
the other by shifting their gold deposited in a London bank to
the other's London bank, thus keeping the gold off the ships -
ergo, out of reach of small-time pirates. (201)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">This is how what is known as the international
&quot;balance of trade&quot; originated with the powerful industrializing
countries of Europe; although rich in technical experience and
inventive &quot;know-how,&quot; they lacked an adequate supply
of fundamental metallic and other resources with which to realize
the industrial potentials for their inventions. They were motivated
to establish military supremacy over nonindustrialized countries
in Africa, South America, and the Far East, within which countries
the European scientists found the metal ores essential to their
industries. (201)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Present-day Ghana provides a good example
of the foregoing. Ghana is rich in bauxite-the ore from which
aluminum is extracted by electrolytic refinement. Ghana also has
the Volta River and its basin.The Ghanaians, however, did not
know of the convertibility of bauxite into aluminum. Americans
with vast capital came into Ghana, arranged to have all the inhabitants
of the Volta River basin banished from that basin, then built
one of the world's largest hydroelectric dams there. They used
the electricity thus generated to convert the Ghanaian bauxite
(which was just so much dirt to the Ghanaians) into aluminum ingots.
These ingots were, and as yet are, shipped to America and Europe,
where the aluminum is transformed into airplanes, cooking utensils,
etc., and sold back to the Ghanaians and others around the world
at such a markup in price that the Ghanaians' balance of import-export
trading finds them ever deeper in debt to those countries that
&quot;developed&quot; their natural resources. The societies in
the manipulating countries call these source people &quot;the
underdeveloped countries&quot; or &quot;the Third World.&quot;

&quot;inventory of vital statistics of the world,&quot; as assembled

also assumes Darwin's &quot;survival only of the fittest&quot;

is why the United States and the U.S.S.R. have jointly spent over
$200 billion annually for the last thirty years ($6 trillion total)
to buy science's most effective means of destroying their respective
&quot;enemies.&quot; World War Gaming is the consequence. World
War Gaming employs the ever-evolutingly- advancing, most comprehensive

to develop and mass-produce weaponry systems that will ever more
swiftly devastate all enemy life-support artifacts and kill ever
more enemy people at ever greater ranges in ever shorter periods

electronic circuitry performances per volumes and weights of apparatus
used - and employs ever- progressively-less weight and volume
of materials, ergs of energy, and seconds of time per each technical

constitute any and all differences existing between the life activities
of originally naked humans in a few mid-ocean tropical &quot;Gardens
of Eden&quot; on planet Earth three million years ago and the
life-styles of humans today in skyscraper cities or in space suits
exiting from their Moon-landed, space-rocketed capsule to bring

known generalized principles and technical inventions and invents
others where artifacts adequate for solving the newly emerging

redesigns the artifacts and technical systems employing those
ever-improving materials. (204)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Gaming recognizes that there are no

If nature does not permit or bring about their associability,
they cannot exist. The substances permitted by nature may be unfamiliar
to humans, but they are never unnatural - i.e., &quot;synthetic.&quot;
World Gaming notes that humans' fear of the unfamiliar often prevents
realization of humanity's imminent acquisition of improved living
conditions for everyone. (204)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Gaming takes advantage of the ever-changing
world-resource patterns, such as that of steel and other metals
scrapped from obsolete buildings and machinery as the latter's
designs are made obsolete by the latest military-and-naval-produced
hardware. Scrap of the discontinued hardware constitutes new high-grade
ore mines existing entirely above ground. As an example: there
are no tin mines in the United States. All tin came originally
either from England, Malaysia, Bolivia, or Tanganyika. Tin was
first used for making bronze, then pewter utensils, then for tinning
bathtubs and cans, next for babbitting of machinery bearings,
soldering. Outperformed by newer, more effective technologies
all of these early tin uses became obsolete, and that tin was
recovered. Since 1940 U.S. aeronautical production tooling has
involved so much tin in its soft tooling phases that the inventory
of ever-remelted tin of the U.S. aircraft industry and its swift-design-change-accomodating
&quot;soft-kirksite&quot; toolings is now (1980) greater than
that remaining in the world mines - ergo, the U.S. requires no
further purchases of foreign tin. Having originally no tin mines,
the U.S. has an aboveground source of tin that is now the world's
largest tin &quot;mine.&quot; World resource maps showing only
the tin-in-the-ground mines are completely misinforming. World
war gaming and those economic advisors of leading governments
use only the in-the-ground-mine data. (204, 205)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">As noted earlier, there are 100 dots on the
Dymaxion Sky-Ocean Map, which is always used as the &quot;playing

now (1980) aboard Spaceship Earth. (205)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Each dot is located at the geometrical center
for the forty-four million people it represents. As the dots show,
approximately 90 percent of humanity live north of the equator.
The 10 percent who live south of the Equator live very close to
it. Humanity is a &quot;northern hemisphere&quot; creature and
is now about to integrate over the North Pole into a one-town
world. We have entered a north-south, air-and-space-vehicle, world
traffic pattern and are swiftly abandoning yesterday's east-west
ship and railway pattern. As the doing-more-work-with-less-pounds-of-material
invisible revolution keeps advancing, we have ever-more-powerful
and greater-weight-and-capacity air vehicles to carry the ever-more-
efficient and -lighter machinery and structures, which classes
of goods were once so heavy as formerly to be shippable only by
sea or rail. (205)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">As mentioned earlier, all the great rivers
of the Earth are clearly shown on the world map. The source of
these rivers' water supply to 54 percent of humanity comes from
a vast frozen reservoir atop the Himalayas-only a small fraction
of this potential waterpower has as yet been dammed for hydroelectric
generation and irrigation system development. With such hydro
development the 54 percent of humanity in China, Southeast Asia,
and India will all become physically prosperous in high degree.
Likewise, the great, as-yet-undeveloped hydroelectric and irrigation
systems of the other continents are clearly demonstrable as holding
high standards of living to be realized for all humanity. (205,

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">It is engineeringly demonstrable that there
is no known way to deliver energy safely from one part of the
world to another in larger quantities and in swifter manner than
by high-voltage-conducted &quot;electricity.&quot; For the first
half of the twentieth century the limit-distance of technically
practical deliverability of electricity was 350 miles. As a consequence
of the post-World War II space program's employment and advancement
of the invisible metallurgical, chemical, and electronics more-with-lessing
technology, twenty-five years ago it became technically feasible
and expedient to employ ultra-high-voltage and superconductivity,
which can deliver electrical energy within a radial range of 1500
miles from the system's dynamo generators. (206)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">To the World Game seminar of 1969 1 presented
my integrated, world-around, high-voltage electrical energy network
concept. Employing the new 1500-mile transmission reach, this
network made it technically feasible to span the Bering Straits
to integrate the Alaskan U.S.A. and Canadian networks with Russia's
grid, which had recently been extended eastward into northern
Siberia and Kamchatka to harness with hydroelectric dams the several
powerful northwardly flowing rivers of northeasternmost U.S.S.R.
This proposed network would interlink the daylight half of the
world with the nighttime half. (206)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Electrical-energy integration of the night
and day regions of the Earth will bring all the capacity into
use at all times, thus overnight doubling the generating capacity
of humanity because it will integrate all the most extreme night
and day peaks and valleys. From the Bering Straits, Europe and
Africa will be integrated westwardly through the U.S.S.R., and
China, Southeast Asia; India will become network-integrated southwardly
through the U.S.S.R. Central and South America will be integrated
southwardly through Canada, the U.S.A., and Mexico. (206)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Graphs of each of the world's 150 nations
showing their twentieth-century histories of inanimate energy
production per capita of their respective populations together
with graphs of those countries' birthrates show without exception
that the birthrates decrease at exactly the same rate that the
per capita consumption of inanimate electrical energy increases.
The world's population will stop increasing when and if the integrated
world electrical energy grid is realized. This grid is the World
Game's highest priority objective. (206)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">There is no single power source around Earth
so great as that of the wind. But winds do not blow in synchronization
with the time patterning of human needs. Generating electricity
when the wind blows and feeding it into batteries and withdrawing
the charge when needed involves a 75-percent in-and-out loss of
the electrical energy. Since 1975, when it was an efficient but
new practice, all fifty U.S.A. states have been required by federal
regulation to allow individual windmill owners to feed their windpower-generated
electric current directly into the local utility power lines.
The individuals get credited for their input on their monthly
electricity bills. This practice was developed by Windworks of
Wisconsin, which in turn was founded by a mid-1960s World Game
prototyping operation. It has been found that within a 100-mile
radius a wind is always blowing. Windmills installed around the
world converting their direct current into alternating current
and feeding the electric energy into the world network can harvest
the planet Earth's prime daily energy income source - the wind
- and adequately supply all the world's energy needs. (206, 208)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">With the world's prime resources and its people
and its potential integratabilities evidenced by World Game's
world map, obvious design science inventions are called for, such
as a &quot;backbone&quot; irrigation canal from the Himalayas
leading south along the central highlands of the Indian continent,
wherewith all the frequently devastating droughts would be eliminated
for India's one-eighth of all humanity. (208)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">With such comprehensive viewability as is
provided by World Game and its Sky-Ocean World Map, it is quickly
realized that (with a few rare exceptions) humanity need do very
little further mining. The metals already scrapped from obsolete
machinery and structures, which recirculate on a sum-total-of-all-metals-average
every twenty-two years, are now able to do so much more work with
ever less weight per each given function with each recirculation
as to make the present scrap resources of almost all metals adequate
to take care of all humanity's forward needs.(208)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">While World Game discovers and identifies
the world income energy sources, (See World Game Laboratory's
Energy, Earth and Everyone by Medard Gabel, Doubleday, rev. ed.,
1980.) it is also concerned with using the energy income in the
most efficient technologies. In producing liquid-fuel-energy-powered
engines, World Game's design science must pay attention to the
fact that reciprocating engines such as are installed in all our
automobiles are only 15-percent efficient, turbines are 30-percent
efficient, jet propulsion engines are 65percent efficient, and
fuel cells are 80-percent efficient. Due to inefficiently designed
technical equipment and building technology, the overall mechanical
efficiency of the United States economy is in 1980 only 5 percent.
This means that for every one hundred units of energy consumed,
ninety-five units go unused-&quot;down the drain.&quot; (208)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Using only proven and now-available technology,
it is feasible to increase the overall efficiency to 15 percent.
This alone would reduce our overall energy consumption by two-thirds.
(209)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">There are two kinds of objective engineering
designing: objects that consist of a plurality of intercomplementarily
moving parts (machinery) and those that do not (structures). Mechanical
efficiency denotes the percent of work effectiveness accomplished
by the machine per units of energy consumed. Structural efficiency
relates to the functions, strength, and durability accomplished
per each unit of weight of material involved. (209)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Humanly occupied environment-controlling structures
have many energy-wasting features, all of which are highly correctable.
In designing the environment-controlling structural enclosures,
World Game's design science heeds the following facts:</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(A) Spherical structures enclose the greatest
  volume with least surface.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(B) Geodesic spherical structures, which
  are inherently omnitriangularly framed entirely of great-circle
  chords, give the strongest structure per weight of materials
  employed.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(C) Amongst the geodesic great-circle spherical
  structures, those based on the discontinuous compression, continuous
  tension-&quot;tensegrity&quot;- icosahedra give the most environmental
  enclosure per pound and volume of material employed.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(D) Every time the linear dimension of a
  symmetrical structure is doubled (i.e. I - 2) the surface area
  of the enclosure increases at a two to the second-power rate
  (i.e., 2'), while the environment-controlling structure's volume
  increases at a two to the third-power rate (i.e., 21).Wherefore,
  every time a geodesic dome's diameter is doubled, it has eight
  times as many contained molecules of atmosphere but only four
  times as much enclosing shell - ergo, each progressive doubling
  of dome diameters halves the amount of enclosing surface through
  which each molecule of interior atmosphere may either gain or
  lose energy as heat. (See &quot;Old Man River's City&quot; project,
  pp. 315-23.) Whole cities are most efficiently enclosed under
  one large dome.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(E) Every time we enclose a geodesic dome
  within a greater-diametered geodesic dome whose radially concentric
  interspacing is greater than the depth of the frost penetration
  of that area, while at the same time avoiding use of any metal
  interconnections between the inner and outer domes' structuring,
  the heat losses and gains of the innermost domes are halved in
  respect to those of non-domed-over domes of the same dimensions.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(F) If in producing the geodesic domes-within-domes
  we make them transparent or translucent on their sunny side and
  opaque and inwardly re-entrap progressively greater amounts of
  Sun energy as heat for longer and greater periods of time as
  the diameters are increased. (209, 210)</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(G) If growing vegetation - i.e., trees,
  vegetables, corn, sugar, ground cover, etc. - is planted within
  the dome, the photosynthetic conversion of Sun radiation into
  hydrocarbon molecules will chemically and simultaneously (1)
  convert the monoxide gases given off by human occupation into
  human-supporting (air) atmosphere, thus eliminating all necessity
  for windows or air conditioning apparatus, and (2) harvest hydrocarbon
  molecule-trapped energy as food or as fuel-alcohol energy.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(H) If the wind drag of buildings is employed
  to turbine-convert wind-power into tank-stored compressed air,
  the latter may be stored within the space between the inner and
  outer domes&#146; skins as low-pressure atmosphere in quantities
  adequate to pneumatically and evenly distribute any concentrated
  outer cover loadings throughout all the tensional components
  of teh geodesic-tenesegrity structures.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(I) As the Sun&#146;s radiation is outwardly
  and diffusingly reflected by the dome structure's convex outer
  surface, vertical thermal-column movements of the Sun-heated
  outside atmosphere develop, which spirally rising columns of
  heated atmosphere will draw air out from under the dome's large
  lower-edge summertime openings, which voluminous outward drafting
  in turn pulls air into the dome through the small crosssectioned
  ventilators at the dome's apex. This pressure differential between
  the small air entry and large exhaust openings produces the Bernoulli
  chilling effect, which in hot weather will swiftly cool the dome's
  interior atmosphere. World Game has proven this in geodesic domes
  at the African equator. (210, 211)</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(J) It is clearly demonstrable that the conversion
  of windpower by dome-within-dome, drag-operated air turbines
  will power the compressing and tank storage of air and will thus
  produce ample power to operate a pneumatic-tool system for all
  mechanical operating needs within the dome. Pneumatic tools avoid
  the human- electrocution perils of electrically operated domestic
  technology. (211, 212)</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(K) Sum-totally it is now demonstrable that
  properly designed domes within domes become energy-harvesting
  machines that provide more energy than is needed for the high-standard
  life support of their human occupants, wherefore such dwelling
  machines may become exporters of energy in variously stored and
  controlled forms, such as alcohol. (212)</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(L) It has been satisfactorily demonstrated
  that the reflective, concave inner surface of the geodesic, dome-within-dome,
  environment-controlling shells will act as parabolic, Sun-radiation
  concentrators, focusing the Sun radiation income into heating
  of a circularly arced, liquid-containing pipe, whereby the Sun's
  heat may be stored liquidly in vacuumenclosed subterranean tanks
  for subsequent use in a variety of ways. The by-product heat
  from the air compressing is used to heat water stored in the
  same reservoir. (212)</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(M) World Game's design science treats the
  tensegrity-structured, dome-within-dome geodesic environment
  controls as comprehensive energy-harvesting, -storing, and -exchanging
  devices. Typically, the vegetation most efficiently employed
  includes the growth of corn and the &quot;winged bean&quot; in
  the sunlight area and mushrooms in t he hot, dark areas.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(N) Radiotelephones and income-energy generators
  render the dwelling machine semiautonomous.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">(0) Two sanitary devices as described earlier
  render the environment controls independent of water-supply lines
  and sewage-carry-away systems: (1) the fog gun for cleaning the
  human skin and all other surfaces with a high-pressure air gun
  into whose airstream small amounts of atomized water are fed;
  (2) the carton packaging and mechanized, convey-away system of
  human wastes to be delivered to elsewhere-located fertilizer
  or gasgenerating works or to anaerobic methane gas and dry fertilizergenerating
  equipment of the dwelling machines themselves. These two devices
  eliminate all wet plumbing, which has been responsible for breeding
  most of all the infectious bacteria heretofore entering human
  abodes, while also eliminating the infectious splashback feature
  of water-filled bowls and their water-flushed toilets. (212)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game finds that wealth measures the
degree to which humans have used their minds to discover scientific
principles and have used those principles to invent artifacts
and environment-controlling and -implementing, complex- artifact
systems which, as powered only by daily energy income, can be
demonstrably shown to be able to take care of given numbers of
people for given numbers of forward days. &quot;Taking care&quot;
of humans means to provide them with &quot;pleasingly,&quot; healthily,
satisfactorily stabilized environmental conditions under all of
nature's known potential variables while adequately feeding them,
giving them medical care, increasing their degrees of freedom,
and increasing their technological options (see Operating Manual
for Spaceship Earth). (212, 213)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">As already mentioned, World Game finds that
the world's wealth and its medium of interchanges - i.e., the
world's monetary accounting systems - have been divorced from
one another. Those bankers and insurance-company managements that
have learned how they may legally employ to their own exclusive
advantage the vast magnitudes of savings of real wealth deposited
with them by those who have produced the wealth and who are quite
unaware that those deposits are taken out of the bank and loaned
out at swiftly increasing interest rates to others in such quantities
as to underwrite the magnitude of purchasing, production, and
sale of products that can be produced only by the involvements
of such vast magnitudes of realwealth tokens, and may therefore
overpower all wealth capabilities of any of the individual depositors
of the savings-account deposits of the realwealth products. (213)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Gaming requires progressive inventorying
of condensed recalls of already introduced major concepts and
their integration with one another, plus additional new concepts
to produce newer and greater synergetic realization. (213)</FONT></H3>

<H3>&nbsp;</H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">In the reality of physical-resource and knowledge
potential we have four billion billionaires on our planet, the
probating and delivery of whose legacy, as amassed by the more-with-lessing
contributions and loving sacrifices of all humans in all history,
has been postponed by the game of making money with money by those
who as yet misinformedly operate on the 1810 Malthusian assumption
that &quot;humanity is multiplying its population at a geometric
rate while increasing its life-support foods, etc., only at an
arithmetic rate&quot; - ergo, the money-makers assume that there
is nowhere nearly enough life support for all. Malthus said the
majority of humans are designed to suffer and die far short of
their potential life-span. Darwin's &quot;survival only of the
fittest&quot; dictum has combined with that of Malthus to persuade
the &quot;haves&quot; to be intelligently selfish and to legally
fortify their &quot;haveness&quot; position against the &quot;have-nots.&quot;
(213)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">With legal planning of their lawyer-advised
banking leaders, the &quot;haves&quot; have now succeeded in cornering
all the world's monetary gold as well as the preponderance of
the world's petroleum sources - along with their refineries and
world-around petro-delivery systems together also with acquisitions
of all the atomic power-generating plants, originally paid for
by the U.S. taxpayers - and thereafter in severing the monetary
system from the wealth system while marking up the negotiable
equity value of gold and petroleum tenfold. They also have contrived
their own game of international monetary banking of international
balances of trade and credit accounting, greatly aided by the
priorly established existence of 150 &quot;sovereign&quot; nations
around planet Earth. (214)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The division of world political power into
150 sovereign nations is a consequence of thousands of years of
successive and individually independent contriving of history's
most powerful leaders. The number-one strategy of the successful
leaders of history's successively established supreme socioeconomic
control systems has always been to induce the spontaneous self-divisioning
of those designed to be conquered and to keep them spontaneously
self-dividing and their divisions lethally interarrayed against
one another in order to keep them conquered. The longer the self-divisionings
can be self-perpetuating, the more spontaneously are the divisions
accepted institutionally by the successive generations as being
&quot;natural&quot; divisions, seemingly as inherently and individually
existent as are different hills, valleys, rivers, and biological
species. The prime vulnerabilities of humanity, which make it
subject to spontaneous self-dividing, are those of different speech
patterns, skin color, religions, social customs, class or caste
systems, political preferences, and all varieties of individually
unique &quot;troubles,&quot; suffering, and discontent. (214)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The historical consequence of this aeons-ago-commenced
employment of this grand strategy of &quot;divide to conquer and
keep divided to keep conquered&quot; accounts for the &quot;natural&quot;
acceptance today by world peoples of the seemingly &quot;God-given&quot;
existence of 150 sovereign nations of the world and their respective
geographical division of all the world's dry land (as well as
for all the specialized categories of human activities). This
prime strategy of supreme-power wielders accounts for all the
many local political divisions within the sovereign nations as
well as for all the religions and for the officially encouraged
maintenance of the many languages and proud maintenance of local
dialects. Above all that number-one strategy accounts for the
emotionally enflamed maintenance of the concepts of different
races and classes of human beings and their division into highly
specialized categories as &quot;culturally&quot; maintained by
the various systems and power structures over all the highly educated
individuals and those intellectuals who, if not focused professionally
on highly specialized subjects, might otherwise-as comprehensivists-seem
potentially dangerous to the rulers. (214, 215)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">It is highly relevant to the foregoing that
in 1959 science had incontrovertibly demonstrated that all the
known anthropological and biological case histories comprehensively
and scientifically explored show that the extinctions of all human
tribes and of all biological species have always been brought
about by overspecializations resultant upon either willful or
environment-induced inbreeding. If, for instance, we inbreed -
by mating two fast-running horses - there is the mathematical
probability of concentrating the fast-running genes but also of
breeding in this special capability only by inadvertently breeding
out the general adaptability to cope with the infrequent high-energy-concentrating
events. For example, exquisitely designed birds' wings are a hindrance
in walking, and the long bills of wading birds, which are perfect
for marshland foraging, are relatively useless in other less specialized
feeding. Generalized adaptability is needed to cope with large
changes in the environment. Here lies the present chief peril
of the human passengers on Spaceship Earth. (215)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game makes it clear that the world electrical
systems' energy-network integration and its comprehensive powering
of automated, special case machinery would most effectively counter
the peril of overspecialization of the humans and would introduce
the omni-Universe-operative, time-energy, kilowatt-hours-per-year,
commonwealth accounting system. This cosmic accounting will computer-establish
the up-to-the-moment-realized cosmic-energy- income-harnessing
thus far accomplished; and the technical-efficiency levels attained
in the various energy-employing technologies operative around
the world; and the resultant per capita individually employable
world commonwealth facilities; and the per capita &quot;consumable,&quot;
&quot;employable,&quot; and &quot;enjoyable&quot; &quot;credits&quot;
in respect to any specific consumables, commodities, services,
conveniences, or tools as manifest on the satellite-relay-integrated
world computers and as individually called for and read out on
each individual's electronic computer &quot;credit card.&quot;
The individually available information will govern the individual's
design science choices of the highest relative-efficiency systems
to be employed. It will also tell people whether they can do this
or that, and if so, how they can go most swiftlyfor instance,
from New York to Australia - and will &quot;book&quot; a travel
reservation and will prepay the bill for the travel accommodation.
All such information is continually computer-integrated to produce
the commonwealth evaluations and their read-out-ability on world-individual's
pocket-computer &quot;credit card.&quot; These will always register
the world individual's share of the ever-increasingly-employable
technological savings reserves and their respective technologically
operative capabilities. With humanity employing such a world-around,
satellite-relayed, and world-integrated computer accounting system,
the world can, overnight, physically realize the &quot;Omnibillionaire
Commonwealth&quot; of its humans. (215, 216)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Because (1) the interalloying of metals produces
the invisible revolution of ever-higher-strength and -durability
performance per pound of material employed, and because (2) the
ever-higher performances produce new conditions of technological
challenge, new alloys and new atomic circuits are progressively
discovered and developed to provide ever- more- satisfactorily-
advanced performances, and because (3) the structures and energy-operated
machines using the ever-improving metal-alloy capabilities progressively
make obsolete the older machines and structures, the latter become
progressively scrapped and melted. It is World Game's concern
to see that the progressively recovered metals are alloyed anew
in ever-higher-performance atomic arrangements and are ever more
promptly re-employed in new machinery and structures of ever-higher
performance with ever-less weights and volumetric bulks. This
progression is known in World Gaming as &quot;Ever-Progressively-Accelerating
Ephemeralization.&quot; (216)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Wherefore: with every accelerated scrapping,
recovery, and recirculation the same basic metals and the alloys
of those metals progressively serve the needs of ever more people
at ever-higher standards of performance. Thus we discover that
the world's already-mined and -used, ever-recirculating metals
become the technologically regenerative, universal &quot;bloodstream&quot;
for realizing the ever-improving know-how of human advancement
of its ever-increasing ability to cope with vital challenges.
The metals, and chemistries in general, have thus become the recirculatable
medium upon which is loaded the new, advanced design science inventions
resultant upon progressively advancing experiences and knowledge
of humanity regarding how to cope more effectively with life's
evolutionarily successive challenges. (216)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Within the twentieth century this invisible
revolution of &quot;continually learning how to do more with the
same&quot; or &#147;more with less&quot; resources (metallurgically,
electronically, chemically, mechanically, structurally, aerodynamically,
and hydrodynamically) has in only three quarters of the twentieth
century brought 60 percent of humanity into enjoying a vastly
more effective, healthier, and more realistically informative
means of coping with life's challenges than was experienced by
the most powerful monarch or financial or political potentate
of 1900; furthermore, during this eighty years of time the world
population has doubled, wherefore the gain has been 120fold. During
this same twentieth century's first eight decades life expectancy
has been doubled for the 60 percent thus advantaged, and the range
of their everyday travelability has twenty-folded. During those
same eighty years that 60 percent of humanity has gone from 90-percent
illiterate to 95-per-cent literate. They are no longer locally
rooted peoples. They are on their way to becoming omni- world-
around living humans preoccupied with local Universe's evolutionary
affairs. In 1948 the average U.S. family moved &quot;out of town&quot;
every five years. In 1978 they moved every three years. (216,
217)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">In 1970 the percent of those unprecedentedly
advantaged passed the 50-percent mark. Since 1970, and for the
first time in history, the majority of humanity has become widely
traveling &quot;haves,&quot; in contrast to the previous multimillions
of years of 99 percent of all humans being locally rooted &quot;have-nots.&quot;
The number of U.S.A. millionaires quintupled in eight years -
from 110,000 in 1971 to 550,000 in 1979. (217)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The plotted curve of the rate of gain for
increasing proportions of all humanity being thus swiftly advantaged
by the doing more for more people with less and less matter and
energy per function - all accomplished with computers, satellites,
alloys, etc. - indicates that 100 percent of all humanity will
be thus advantaged before 2000 A.D. In less than twenty years
(less than one generation) all humanity is scheduled by evolution
(not by any world planning body) to become physically more successful
and,metaphysically more interestingly occupied than have any humans
ever been in all known history-provided that humanity does not
commit ignorance-, fear-, and -panic-induced total-species suicide.
(217)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Why might they panic? All the present bureaucracies
of political governments, great religious organizations, and all
big businesses find that physical success for all humanity would
be devastating to the perpetuation of their ongoing activities.
This is because all of them are founded on the premise of ameliorating
individual cases while generally exploiting on behalf of their
respective political, religious, or business organizations the
condition of nowhere- nearly- enough-life-support-for-all and
its resultant great human suffering and discontent. (217)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Reason number two for fear-wrought panic is
because all of the 150 nations of our planet are about to be desovereignized
by evolution; that is, they are about to become operatively obsolete
- about to be given up altogether. There are millions in the U.S.A.,
for instance, who on discovery that their government was about
to become bankrupt and defunct would become activist &quot;patriots,&quot;
and might get out their guns and start a Nazi movement, seeking
dictatorially to reinstate the &quot;good old days.&quot; If people
in many of the 150 nations succeeded in re-establishing their
sovereignties and all the customs-barrier, balance-of-trade shacklings,
it would soon be discovered that the 150 nations represent 150
&quot;blood clots&quot; imperiling the free interflowing of the
evolution-producing metals and products recirculation as well
as of the popular technical know-how disseminating. (217)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">We have today, in fact, 150 supreme admirals
and only one ship - Spaceship Earth. We have the 150 admirals
in their 150 staterooms each trying to run their respective stateroom
as if it were a separate ship. We have the starboard side admirals'
league trying to sink the port side admirals' league. If either
is successful in careening the ship to drown the &quot;enemy&quot;
side, the whole ship will be lost. (217, 218)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Long ago the world's great religions learned
how to become transnational or more effectively supranational.
Next the world's great ideologies learned how to become supranational.
Most recently the world's largest financial- enterprise corporations
have become completely supranational in their operation. Big religion,
ideologies, and businesses alike found it intolerable to operate
only within 150 walled-in pens. Freeing themselves by graduating
into supranational status, they have left all the people in the
150 pens to struggle with all the disadvantages of 150 mutually
opposed economic policies. The European Economic Community is
a local attempt to cope with this world problem. (218)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The United States of America is not a nation.
Nations are large tribes of humans that have been geographically
isolated for millennia and have progressively inbred the physical
types surviving under those unique geographical conditions. As
mentioned, the U.S.S.R. had 146 naturally evolved nations&quot;
to integrate, the physiognomies of each U.S.S.R. nation looking
quite different from the others'. The United States of America
is a crossbreeding integration of humans from all the nations
of the planet Earth; though often speaking of itself as the United
States of America, it is not America. Its population is only one-half
that of North and South America. The North Americans, consisting
of Canadians, the U.S. citizens, and Mexicans, are evolutionarily
cross-breeding into a single hybrid family of world humans. (218)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">As a sequel to the foregoing scientific data
(see Chapter 1, pp. 9-1 1), which proves the invalidity of humanity's
assumption of a plurality of different races and classes of humans
to exist on our planet, the computer will be able to help in discovering
the swiftest course for humanity to pursue in order to free itself
of such self-deception. The computer can also disclose the economic
savings of humanity to be accomplished by elimination of race,
class, and creed differentials. The computers can and will show
the increases in commonwealth to be realized by such elimination
of false premises in social judgments. (218)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Gaming produces truthful, ergo corresponding,
insights that are popularly communicable by world-around, satellite-relayed

progressively intercooperative humanity. (218)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">It is the invisibility of the alloys and chemistries
and of the electronic circuitry of the design science revolution
which finds that revolution to be as yet uncomprehended and ignorantly
opposed by humanity's reliance only on yesterday's politically
visible means of problem-solving. It is both the invisibility
and misinformedness that occasions the lack of spontaneous popular
support of the invisible design science revolution by the most
powerful political and money-making systems. Big government can
see no way to collect taxes to run its bureaucracy if people are
served directly and individually by daily cosmic-energy-wealth
income. Money-makers cannot find a way of putting meters between
people and the wind, Sun, waves, etc. Neither big government nor
big business pays any serious attention to the fact that we can
live on our energy income, rather than on nature's energy savings
account (fossil fuels), or by burning our Spaceship Earth's physical
hull, which consists entirely of atomic energy in the form of
matter. (218, 219)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">In 1969 I initiated, and students developed,
what have since become annual World Game seminars, attended by
university faculties, students, scientists, engineers, and government
officials - for its first three years at Southern Illinois University,
next at the University of Southern California, and thereafter
for four years at the University of Pennsylvania, and for one
year at the University of Massachusetts. In 1979 the seminar was
conducted partially at New York University and partially at the
University of Pennsylvania; in 1980, at the University of Pennsylvania.
(219)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Seven years ago the World Game's annual research
activity culminated in a book written by Medard Gabel, Energy,
Earth, and Everyone (Doubleday, rev. ed., 1980), which demonstrated
beyond any argument that humanity can carry on handsomely and
adequately when advantaged only by its daily energy income from
the Sun-gravity system. World Game also published a second book
by Medard Gabel, Ho-Ping.- Food for Everyone (Doubleday, 1979)
- this time on world food resources, which shows that we can take
ample care of all human food needs. The 1979 World Game was participated
in by many experts on world food matters. (219)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game will become increasingly effective
in its prognoses and programming when the world-around, satellite-interrelayed
computer system and its omni-Universe-operative (time-energy)

kilowatt-hour-expressed world inventory of foods, raw and recirculating
resources, and all the world's unique mechanical and structural
capabilities and their operating capacities as well as the respective
kilowatt-hours of available energy-income-derived operating power
with which to put their facilities to work. All the foregoing

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World government will require all industries
to install the already-successfully-proven technology and therewith
precipitate and recover all their profitwise-unwanted chemical
by-products. Underwriting all those costs of installation and
operation, world government will give tax credits to all those
industries complying with the order, so that those industries
can compete with those in the industry who do not have such pollution
problems. World government will then stockpile all the chemical
substances recovered from all previous liquid, gaseous, or solid
dumpings, fumings, or runnings- off-known ignorantly as &quot;pollution.&quot;
The value of the recovered resources will more than offset the
tax rebates given by the government in order to enforce precipitation.
All the chemical substances in all their states are essential
to the maintenance of the integrity of eternally regenerative
Universe. Nature has no &quot;pollution.&quot; This is a word
coined in human ignorance regarding the presence of the right
chemicals being released in the wrong places by those who profit
only through selfish preoccupation and nonconsideration of others.
The hour-to-hour changes in the inventory of world&not; government
stockpiling of all recirculatable substances will be constantly
fed into the world-integrated computer together with locations
and summaries of the total inventories available for new tasks.
World government will replace altogether all the scrapmongers
who, to increase prices, hold their products off the market until
they become scarce. (220)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game records make it clear that the
big money-makers of early U.S.A. history, those who funded the
Harvard Business School, the Wharton School of Finance, etc.,
may have made their money in ways that were legal but ruthlessly
scheming. The students at today's business schools are not given
courses on how to cheat your mother-in-law or how to sell your
friends short. Because the business schools make it plausible
that fortunes may be won in a legal manner, we have present-day
business executives trying to find legal ways of getting the public's
money. (220)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Gaming makes it eminently clear that
the simplest way for top executives of the supercorporations to
make profits and keep their own salaries rising is to make their
corporation the first in its field to raise prices despite any
government, public, or labor opposition. The second way is to
cut down on personnel at the retailing level and to force customers
to wait in lines. No single human waiting line seems too formidable
by itself, but if we consider all those standing in all the lines
at all the different airlines at all the world's airports-as the
computer does-and all the people wanting to secure an airline
ticket waiting for half an hour on the telephone after hearing
the ticket clerk's &quot;Please hold,&quot; and all the people
waiting for twenty minutes to place their orders in all the restaurants
around the world, we discover the billions of human hours sacrificed
daily by people whose time is of high value. Those in lines are
being legally robbed of billions of their life-hour dollars, which
go to the corporate profit account as savings in labor costs.

  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">2. Available only within ten miles of the

  the world's waves.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">3. Available in sufficient quantity to sustain

  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">5. Not everywhere or everywhen available:
  water, food, clothing, shelter, vision, initiative, friendliness.</FONT></H3>
  <H3><FONT SIZE="+0">6. Only partially available for individual
  human consumption, being also required for industrial production:
  e.g., water.</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game's integrated world computer system
will have the task of differentiating out the abundant resources
and facilities from the scarce, and differentiating the scarce
into degrees of scarcity as well as into the day-today fluctuations
of the borderline cases. The computer will keep constant track
of where the resources are geographically located or where they
are traveling. That which is in constant abundance is 100-percent
socializable. That which is scarce must be reserved for tasks
that serve all society in general. The element oxygen in the atmosphere
is in abundance at sea level and need not be distributed by artifacts.
Oxygen at I 1,000 feet and more above sea level is critically
scarce and must be compressed into tanks and distributed for breathing
through masks and tubes. (221)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The gas helium is very scarce on planet Earth.
It has very important, unique characteristics. Number one, it
is not flammable, as is hydrogen, though it weighs almost as little
as hydrogen. Helium, though the socially theoretical property
of everyone, becomes useless to anyone if compressed into four
billion separate bottles, each of which is distributed to each
of our at-present four billion Earthians. There are a number of
technical tasks that helium can perform to the advantage of all
humanity, all of which can be programmed into the computer. (222)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The relative abundance of the ninety-two regenerative
chemical elements in the thus-far-known Universe is about the
same as the inventory of their relative abundance on Earth. The
relative abundance of the chemical elements is also approximately
the same as that of their occurrence in the organisms of the human
bodies. All this data and all the tasks that can be performed
by each element to the greatest advantage of all humanity will
be programmed into the world-integrated computers to make it evident
to all humanity which eco-technological strategy at any given
time will produce the highest advantage for all, against which

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">It was World Game that asked, as described
before, one of the world's greatest oil geologists, Francois de
Chaden6des, if he could write an accurate scenario of nature producing
petroleum on planet Earth through the photosynthetic transformation-into-hydrocarbon
of Sun radiation by the vegetation and algae and the succession
of events following their transformation as the vegetation is
consumed by other biologicals, or is transformed into various
residues, all of which are blown by winds or washed by streams
and gradually accumulate in various geographical locations and
become progressively buried within the planet's outer crust. Thereafter
there were various heats and pressures (caused by ice ages, etc.),
earthquakes, or deep burial below water or soil until those chemical
heats and pressure conditions occurred which are essential to
the production of petroleum. De Chaden6des said he could, and
after a year he presented us with the scenario with all of its
time increments and pressure conditions spelled out. We then asked
him to figure how much it would cost nature per each gallon of
petroleum for that much pressure and heat for that much time,
were it calculated at the retail rate for that much energy for
that length of time as charged us by the public utilities. The
cost came to well over a million dollars per gallon. (222)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Since World Game's accounting system is that
of the Universe's own time-energy intertransforming requirements,
we must accept as cosmically unquestionable this costing of petroleum,
coal, and gas resources, which nature has been syntropically importing
and accumulating on planet Earth in order, ten billion years hence,
to turn the Earth into an energy-exporting (entropic) star. (222,
223)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">For this reason World Game considers all fossil
fuels to be nature's own savings account, deposited in our &quot;Earth
bank&quot; and not to be stolen by exploiters. Everyone knows
that we should live on our (energy) income and not our savings
account. Nor should we burn our capital-account production equipment
in order to produce meter-marketable energy, for there will soon
be no further production capability. Atomic energy by fission
or fusion constitutes burning our terrestrial production equipment.

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">As mentioned, World Game finds that 60 percent
of all the jobs in the U.S.A. are not producing any real wealth
- i.e., real life support. They are in fear-underwriting industries
or are checking-on-other-checkers, etc. The majority of the jobs
occasion the individuals using three to four gallons per day in
their automobiles to go to and from work - at true cosmic costing
this means four million dollars per worker per day. Obviously
the computer finds that it would save the planet Earth's energy
account $500 trillion a day to give all the non-wealth-producing
workers their full pay to stay at home. (223)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">In the same way the World Game's world-around-integrated
computers will show that it will save-pay handsomely to pay all
professors and teachers in full to stay at home or in their laboratories
and relinquish all teaching to video cassettes, whose selectable
programs are to be called out bylthe individual students of all
ages around the world to be shown on their home television sets.
The old educational facilities and a small fraction of individual
teachers who love most to teach will use the old educational facilities
within which to produce the cassette programs. (223)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The computer will prove to society that it
will pay to introduce automation wherever feasible and to allow
the machines to work twenty-four-hour days while paying yesterday's
workers in full to stay home. Only those who love each particular
technology will keep the world-around video education in operation.
Those who pass the exams to qualify for such working will not
be paid for it. They will act as does any amateur athlete-doing
what they do for the love of it. This competing to qualify for
all the production and service jobs will govern all work. The
work will not be paid for. Everything the individual needs is
already paid for. Rudyard Kipling's &quot;L'Envois&quot; tells
the story. (223)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game shows that we can discontinue newspapers
and save the trees for fuel-alcohol production. World Game finds
that all news can be disseminated by television and that computers
can keep track of all the information that fills the advertising
and want-advertisement pages, and any individual looking for any
kind of opportunity can get the matching information from the
computer in seconds. Individuals can go shopping by cable television.

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Local Universe is the term used by World Game
to identify the macrocosmic limits of human observation. These
macro-limits are identified as the radius of the present maximum
phototelescopic-and-radar-reached information (in 1980 the spherical
sweepout of an approximately eleven-and-one-half-billion-light-year
radius) around planet Earth in all directions. (224)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game takes the inventory of relative
abundance of all the chemical elements present within that radius
as spectroscopically analyzed by the light received in all directions
around us from all the stars of all the galaxies within that eleven-and-one-half-billion-light-year
radial distance. (224)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game takes the relative abundance of
all the chemical elements thus far found on planet Earth. The
local Universe inventories and the Earthian inventory of the relative
abundance are somewhat similar, as is the relative abundance of
the chemical elements present or acceptably present in human beings'
bodies. The Earthian inventory includes all the isotopes of all
the chemical elements and the relative abundance of the latter.
In respect to the Earthian abundance, some of the elements are
so relatively plenitudinous as to make them available for various
universal technological uses; they are therefore socializable,
but only when employed with other elements in instruments, machinery,
structures, medicines, and nutriment. (224)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game notes that gold is the most electrically
conductive of all elements. It is also the most highly reflective
of all metals, and therefore has many functional uses. New computer
circuiting and such functions as the new laser energy beaming
with rubies will occupy the majority of the rare metals and jewels.
(225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Rubies function in producing laser beams,
etc. Diamonds, being the hardest of all elements, have many cutting
and other technical functions. All the rare stones and metals
will have industry's unique industrial tasks to perform. The question
then arises as to who will determine which technological initiatives
should have prior access to the inherently scarce, high-advantage
functionings of the scarce and rare inventories of chemical elements.
(225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game finds that the computers fed with
all the relevant energy-efficiency facts will be able to demonstrate
which uses will produce the greatest long-term benefit for all
humanity. (225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game foresees that the greatest problems
for humanity to solve in the future will be how to accommodate
the initiatives of millions of humans who, freed from muscle-
and nerve-reflexing jobs, find their inventory of past experiences
and their minds integrating synergetically to envision evergreater
advantages to be realized for humanity. We will realize this age
of regenerative inventing which is rendering humans very effective
in their cosmic functioning as local Universe information-gatherers
and local Universe problem-solvers in support of the integrity
of eternally regenerative Universe. (225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">I consider it essential to pay all my bills
in the swiftest possible manner. In whatever system I find myself
I commit myself to &quot;play the game,&quot; for I am not a political
revolutionary; I am a design science revolutionary. (225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Responding to criticism by individuals who
said that the reason Buckminster Fuller was not trying to &quot;earn
his living&quot; was because he was incapable of doing so, I told
one of my audiences in 1947 about Obnoxico, a theoretical enterprise
I had invented through which I could make vast amounts of dollars
in one year on an entirely legal basis - but one as typically
undesirable to me as is all money-making. (225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">I said, &quot;You have to decide whether you
want to make money or make sense, because the two are mutually
exclusive.&quot; (225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">I do not consider it to be money-making when
I insist upon being refunded for the development and overhead
cost of the services I perform annually for others, which performance
I undertake only in response to the requests of others. (225)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">The private-enterprise corporation called
Obnoxico was schematically designed only to serve as an object
lesson. Obnoxico was designed to exploit the most sentimental
weaknesses of humanity. In my theoretical Obnoxico's catalog the
number-one item suggested that on the last day that your baby
wears diapers you very carefully remove them, repin them empty,
and stuff them full of tissue paper in just the shape in which
they were when last occupied by your baby. You pack this assembly
carefully into a strong corrugated-paperboard container and send
it to Obnoxico, which will base- metallize the diapers, then gold-
or silver-plate them and send them back to you to be filled with
ferns and hung in the back window of your car. The easily forecastable
profits from this one item ran into millions of dollars per year.
(225, 226)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Eagerly my friends of 1947 on being told of
Obnoxico joined in the fun and began inventing items for its catalog.
Next they began sending me Obnoxico items then beginning to come
on the market in 1950 for the first time and as advertised in
magazines: plastic pebbles for your garden walk and the now-prevalent,
but then-new, plastic flowers. (226)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">I then showed how the contributors of the
original items sent to me in fun - to keep the joke going - could
be persuaded to accept shares in Obnoxico in exchange for their
contributions. Then the Faustian aspect of the enterprise revealed
itself, for it was clearly foreseeable that the stockholders would
swiftly become so rich that they would tend to take the whole
matter seriously. Overnight they would lose their sense of humor
as their greed was stimulated and they became ruthlessly deliberate
exploiters of humanity. (226)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Somehow or other the theoretical Obnoxico
concept has now twenty-five years later become a burgeoning reality.
Private enterprise is now building airports with ever-longer walkways
and hotels with ever-increasing numbers of levels of ground-floor
and basement arcades to accommodate the evermore-swiftly multiplying
Obnoxico stores. (226)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">Human beings traveling away from home with
cash in their pockets, thinking fondly of those left behind or
soon-to-be-joined loved ones, are hooked by the realistic statuettes
of four-year-old girls and boys with upturned faces saying in
a cartoon &quot;balloon,&quot; &quot;What did you bring me, Daddy?&quot;
(226)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">As the banking system pleads for more savings-account
deposits (so that they can loan your money out to others at interest
plus costs) the Obnoxico industry bleeds off an ever-greater percentage
of all the potential savings as they are sentimentally or jokingly
spent for acrylic toilet seats with dollar bills cast in the transparent
plastic material, two teddy bears hugging an alligator, etc. (226)</FONT></H3>

<H3><FONT SIZE="+0">World Game is Anti-Obnoxico and commits itself
to making Obnoxico and allied activities obsolete rather than
attacking it directly. (226)</FONT></H3>
