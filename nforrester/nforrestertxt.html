<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">1.1 Overview</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">This book presents a system dynamics
model of the life cycle of national economic development. The
life cycle of economic development, occuring in the span of a
few hundred years, can be divided into the phases of growth, transition,
and equilibrium. During the growth phase, population, production,
and industrialization increase exponentially. During the transition
phase, economic growth encounters mounting negative pressure from
physical and social limits to growth. During the equilibrium phase,
the forces producing and restraining growth are in balance. The
model deals with a 250-year period of the development life cycle
and focuses on changes occuring during the 100-year transition
phase between growth and equilibrium. (1)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The model deals with the shifting
allocation of labor and capital between major production sectors
to balance the needs of the population during the life cycle of
development. Within each sector, capital accumulation is controlled
by the relative marginal productivities of capital and labor.
Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the model structure and
a preview of the model behavior. Chapter 2 examines the structure
of the model in more detail. Chapter 3 analyzes three different
life-cycle modes generated by the model. Chapter 4 examines the
effects of four different development strategies on a single life-cycle
mode. Chapter 5 presents observations on the model's behavior
and examines the use of system dynamics in policy planning. The
appendices present the details of the formal computer model used
in this study. (1)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">1.2 Introduction to Model
Structure</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">In the model, economic activity
is divided into five production sectors- agriculture, goods, services,
capital, and resources. Each sector has a functional niche in
the economy, and the sectors fit together in a structural network.

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Figure 1-1 Material flows
in the model</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Figure 1 - 1 illustrates the material
flows between sectors. The five production sectors are linked
together through the population. All production sectors support
the flow of food, goods, and services to the population while
the population supplies labor to all five sectors. (2)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Figure 1 -1 shows that the agricultural
sector produces food. The agricultural sector uses labor, capital,
and land as inputs to food production. The activities of the agricultural
sector include farming, fishing, food processing, and the production
of short-life goods used in food production like fertilizers,
pesticides, and seeds. The labor in agriculture includes all people
working in connection with activities of the agricultural sector.
The capital in agriculture includes not only farm machinery, fertilizers,
factories, buildings, and land improvements, but also investment
in knowledge of production techniques. Capital has an average
lifetime of about 25 years. The fertility and distribution of
land in combination with the climate determine the quantity of
food that can be produced by a given amount of labor and capital
in agriculture. (2)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The goods sector produces durable
goods that are used or operated by the consumer public. The goods
sector uses labor, capital, and processed resources to produce
goods. The activities of the goods sector include production of
housing, cars, clothing, and recreational facilities. Consumer
goods have an average lifetime of between five and ten years.
The processed resources input to the goods sector includes wood,
plastics, cement, metals, and energy. (2)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Figure 1-1 shows that the services
sector produces services for the population. The services sector
uses direct labor and capital as production inputs. The services
sector is assumed to have no resource input except indirectly
through the resources in its capital. The activities in the services
sector include work in health, government, education, arts, banking,
transportation, communication, hotels, and restaurants as well
as repairs and personal services. Business services are considered
part of the activity in the appropriate production sector. Services
are nonphysical and therefore have no lifetime. (3)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The capital sector produces capital
for all five production sectors including itself. The capital
sector uses labor, capital, and processed resources as production
inputs. The activities in the capital sector include research
and development, manufacture of machinery, professional training,
and construction of productive structures such as factories, roads,
and dams. Both knowledge of productive techniques and capital
goods are classified as capital in the model. Capital is any form
of output with a long lifetime that is used as an input to production.
The average lifetime of capital is approximately 25 years. (3)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The resources sector produces processed
resources for the goods and capital sectors. The resources sector
uses labor, capital, and natural resources as production inputs.
The activities in the resources sector include production of metal,
chemicals, plastics, building materials, oil, and energy. The
natural resources tapped by the resources sector are the nonrenewable
inputs from nature. (3)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The circular structure of the model
is evident from Figure 1-1. The two secondary sectors-capital
and resources-support the consumer sectors. Output from the three
consumer sectors-food, goods, and services-supports the population.
Labor from population supports all five production sectors. The
only factors of production that lie outside the circular flow
pattern are the environmental production inputs-natural resources
and land. (3)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Figure 1-1 should be used for reference
and orientation while reading about the structures that control
dynamic behavior in Chapter 2 and Appendix A. (3)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">1.3 Preview of Model Behavior</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The model generates several different
life-cycle behavior modes. These modes are discussed in Chapter
3. Figure 1-2 illustrates one possible life-cycle mode of development
for the Canadian economy over a 250-year period. The figure begins
in 1900 during the growth phase. The growth continues until about
the year 2000. The transition of the life-cycle begins in about
2000 and continues through 2100. The equilibrium phase begins
in 2100 and continues beyond 2150. (3)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The curves plotted in Figure 1-2
show the behaviors of several model variables. Population grows
exponentially during the growth phase and into the transition
phase. By approximately 2075 in the transition phase, population
growth begins to slow. By 2150 in the equilibrium phase population
growth has nearly ceased. The end of population growth is produced
in the model by overcrowding. As population density increases,
the birth rate slowly falls until it equals the death rate and
population growth stops. (3, 4)</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Figure 1-2</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">As shown in Figure 1-2, the allocation
of labor between sectors shifts during the development life-cycle.
During the growth phase, until 2000, the fraction of productive
labor in agriculture declines and the fraction of productive labor
in services rises. The reallocation of labor from agriculture
to services occurs because capital accumulation raises productivity
in the agriculture sector, releasing labor to satisfy the lower
priority need for services. During the transition phase, the fraction
of productive labor in the capital sector peaks and falls. Labor
is reallocated away from the capital sector because of declining
demand for capital produced by increase in the cost of capital.
The cost of capital increases due to increase in the cost of resources.
The cost of resources rises because resource extraction efficiency
declines. During the equilibrium phase, labor is reallocated to
the resources sector to compensate for the loss of extraction
efficiency. Resource extraction efficiency falls sharply during
the transition phase, due to accelerating depletion of high grade,
easily accessible resources as the economy grows and becomes more
prosperous. (4)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The fraction of labor time nonproductive
(a measure of the amount of leisure time available) rises during
the growth phase, peaks during the transition, and declines in
the equilibrium phase. The fraction of labor time nonproductive
declines because labor is reallocated to the resources sector.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Figure 1-2 simply illustrates the
type of behavior generated by the model: the underlying causes
of changes are explained more fully in Chapter 5. (5)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The model behavior is produced by
the individual causal relationships between model variables. The
following chapter examines some of the important causal loops
in the model. (5)</FONT></P>
