  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">THE SPEENHAMLAND SYSTEM was originally
  no more than a makeshift.  Yet few institutions have shaped the
  fate of a whole civilization more decisively than this, which
  had to be discarded before the new era could begin.  It was the
  typical product of an age of transformation and deserves the
  attention of any student of human affairs today.Under the mercantile
  system the labor organization of England rested on the Poor Law
  and the Statute of Artificers.  Poor Law, as it applied to the
  laws of  1536 to 1601, is admittedly a misnomer; actually these
  laws, and subsequent amendments, formed half of the labor code
  of England; the other half consisted of the Statute of Artificers
  of 1563- The latter dealt with the employed; the Poor Law, with
  what we would call the unemployed and unemployable (apart from
  the aged and children).  To these measures were added later,
  as we saw, the 'Act of Settlement of 1662 concerning the legal
  abode of the people restricted their mobility to the utmost.
  (The neat distinction between employed, unemployed, and unemployable
  is, of course, anachronistic since it implies the existence of
  a modern wage system which was absent for another 250 years or
  so; we use these terms for the sake of simplicity in this very
  broad presentations) (86)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">. Labor organization, according
  to the Statute of Artificers, rested on three pillars: enforcement
  of labor, seven years' apprenticeship, and yearly wage assessments
  by public officials.  The law - this should be emphasized - applied
  to agricultural laborers as much as to artisans, and was enforced
  in rural districts as well as in towns.  For about eighty years
  the Statute was strictly executed; later the apprenticeship clauses
  fell partly into desuetude being restricted to the traditional
  crafts; to the new industries like cotton they simply did not
  apply; yearly wage assessments, based on the cost of living,
  also were in abeyance in a part of the country after the Restoration
  (166o).  Formally, the large assessment clauses of the Statute
  were repealed only in 1813, the wage clauses in 1814. However,
  in many respects the apprenticeship rule survived the Statute;
  it is still the general practice in the skilled trades in England.
   The enforcement of labor in the countryside was discontinued
  little by little.  Still it can be<BR>
  said that for the two and a half centuries in question the Statute
  of Artificers laid down the outlines of a national organization
  of labor based on the principles of regulation and paternalism.
  (86, 87)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Statute of Artificers was
  thus supplemented by the Poor Laws, a most confusing term in
  modern ears, to which &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;pauper&quot;
  sound much alike.  Actually, the gentlemen of England judged
  all persons poor who did not command an income sufficient to
  keep them in leisure.  &quot;Poor&quot; was thus practically
  synonymous with &quot;common people,&quot; and the common people
  comprised all but the landed classes (hardly any successful merchant
  failed to acquire landed property).  Hence the term &quot;poor&quot;
  meant all people who were in need and all the people, if and
  when they were in need.  This, of course, included paupers, but
  not them alone.  The aged, the infirm, the orphans had to be
  taken care of in a society which claimed that within its confines
  there was a place for every Christian.  But over and above, there
  were the able-bodied poor, whom we would call the unemployed
  on the assumption that they could earn their living by manual
  work if only they could find employment.  Beggary was severely<BR>
  punished; vagrancy, in case of repetition, was a capital offense.
   The Poor Law of 1601 decreed that the able-bodied poor should
  be put to work so as to earn their keep, which the parish was
  to supply;<BR>
  the burden of relief was put squarely on the parish, which was
  empowered to raise the necessary sums by local taxes or rates.
   These were to be levied upon all householders and tenants, rich
  and nonrich alike, according to the rental of the land or houses
  they occupied. (87)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Statute of Artificers and
  the Poor Law together provided what might be called a Code of
  Labor.  However, the Poor Law was administered locally; every
  parish - a tiny unit - had its own provisions for setting the
  able-bodied to work; for maintaining a poorhouse; for apprenticing
  orphans and destitute children; for caring for the aged and the
  infirm; for the burial of paupers; and every parish had its own
  scale of rates.  All this sounds grander than it often was; many
  parishes had no poorhouses; a great many more had no reasonable
  provisions for the useful occupation of the able-bodied; there
  was an endless variety of ways in which the sluggardliness of
  the local ratepayers, the indifference of the overseers of the
  poor, the callousness of the interests centering on pauperism
  vitiated the working.of the law. Still, by and large, the nearly
  sixteen thousand Poor Law authorities of the country managed
  to keep the social fabric of village life unbroken and undamaged.
  (87, 88)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Yet under a national system of
  labor, the local organization of unemployment and poor relief
  was a patent anomaly.  The greater the variety of local provisions
  for the poor, the greater the danger to the well-kept parish
  that it would be swamped by the professional pauper. After the
  Restoration the Act of Settlement and Removal was passed to protect
  the &quot;better&quot; parishes from the influx of paupers. More
  than a century later, Adam Smith inveighed against this Act because
  it immobilized the people, and thus prevented them from finding
  useful employment as it prevented the capitalist from finding
  employees.  Only with the good will of the local magistrate and
  the parish authorities could a man stay in any other but his
  home parish; everywhere else he was liable to expulsion even
  though in good<BR>
  standing and employed.  The legal status of the people was therefore
  that of freedom and equality subject to incisive limitations.
   They were equal before the law, and free as to their persons.
   But they were not free to choose their occupations or those
  of their children; they were not free to settle where they pleased;
  and they were forced  to labor.  The two great Elizabethan Statutes
  and the Act of Settlement together were a charter of liberty
  to the common people as well as a seal of their disabilities.(88)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Industrial Revolution was
  well on the way, when in 1795, under the pressure of the needs
  of industry, the Act of 1662 was paritially repealed, parish
  serfdom Was abolished, and the physical mobility of the laborer
  was restored.  A labor market could now be established on a national
  scale.  But in the very same year, as we know, a practice of
  Poor Law administration was introduced which meant the reversal
  of the Elizabethan principle of enforced labor.  Speenhamland
  ensured the &quot;right to live&quot;; grants in aid-of-wages
  were made general; family allowances were superadded; and all
  this was to be given in outdoor relief, i.e., without committing
  the recipient to the workhouse.  Although the scale of relief
  was exiguous, it was enough for bare subsistence.  This was a
  return to regulationism and paternalism with a vengeance just
  when, it would seem, the steam engine was clamoring for freedom
  and the machines were crying out for human hands.  Yet the Speenhamland
  Law coincided in time with the<BR>
  withdrawal of the Act of Settlement.  The contradiction was patent:
  the Act of Settlement was being repealed because the Industrial
  Revolution demanded a national supply of laborers who would offer
  to work for wages, while Speenhamland proclaimed the principle
  that no man need fear to starve and that the parish would keep
  him and his family how ever little he earned. There was stark
  contradiction between the two industrial policies; what else
  but a social enormity could be expected from their simultaneous
  continued application? (88, 89)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But the generation of Speenhamland
  was unconscious of what was on its way.  On the eve of the greatest
  industrial revolution in history, no signs and portents were
  forthcoming.  Capitalism arrived unannounced.  No one had forecast
  the development of a machine industry; it came as a complete
  surprise.  For some time England had been actually expecting
  a permanent recession of foreign trade when the dam burst, and
  the old world was swept away in one indomitable surge towards
  a planetary economy.(89)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, not until the 1850's
  could anybody have said so with assurance.  The key to the comprehension
  of the Speenhamland magistrates' recommendation lay in their
  ignorance of the wider irnplications of the development they
  were facing.  In the retrospect it may seem as if they had not
  only attempted the impossible, but had done so by means the inner
  contradictions of which should have been apparent at the time.
   Actually they were successful in achieving their aim of protecting
  the village against dislocation, while the effects of their policy
  were all the more disastrous in other, unforeseen directions.
  Speenhamland policy was the outcome of a definite phase in the
  development of a market for labor power and should be understood
  in the light of the views taken of that situation by those in
  the position to shape policy.  From this angle the allowance
  system will appear as contrived by squirearchy to meet a situation
  in which physical mobility could no longer be denied to labor,
  while the squire wished to avoid such unsettlement of local conditions,
  including higher wages, as was involved in the acceptance of
  a free national labor market. (89)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The dynamic of Speenhamland was
  thus rooted in the circumstances of its origin.  The rise in
  rural pauperism was the first symptom of the impending upheaval.
   Yet nobody seemed to have thought so at the time.  The connection
  between rural poverty and the impact of world trade was anything
  but obvious.  Contemporaries had no reason to link the number
  of the village, poor with the development of cornmercc in the
  Seven Seas.  The inexplicable increase in the number of the poor
  was almost generally put down to the method of Poor Law without
  some good cause.  Actually, beneath the surface, the ominous
  growth of rural pauperism was directly linked with the trend
  of general economic history.  But this connection was still hardly
  perceptible.  Scores of writers probed into the channels by which
  the poor trickled into the village, and the number as well as
  the variety of reasons adduced for their appearance was amazing.
   And yet only a few contemporary writers pointed to those symptoms
  of the<BR>
  dislocations which we are used to connect with the Industrial
  Revolution.  Up to 1785  the English public was unaware of any
  major change in economic life, except for a fitful increase of
  trade and the growth of pauperism.(89, 90)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Where do the poor come from?
  was the question raised by a bevy of pamphlets which grew thicker
  with the advancing century.  The causes of pauperism and the
  means of combating it could hardly be expected to be kept apart
  in a literature which was inspired by the conviction that if
  only the most apparent evils of pauperism could be sufficiently
  alleviated it would cease to exist altogether.  On one point
  there appears to have been general agreement, namely, on the
  great variety of causes that accounted for the fact of the increase.
   Amongst them were scarcity of grain; too high agricultural wages,
  causing high food prices; too low agricultural wages; too high
  urban wages; irregularity of urban employment; disappearance
  of the yeomanry; ineptitude of the urban worker for rural occupations;
  reluctance of the farmers to pay higher wages; the landlords'
  fear that rents would have to be reduced if higher wages were
  paid; failure of the workhouse to compete with machinery; want
  of domestic economy;<BR>
  incommodious habitations; bigoted diets; drug habits.  Some writers
  blamed a new type of large sheep; others, horses which should
  be replaced by oxen; still others urged the keeping of fewer
  dogs. Some writers believed that the poor should eat less, or
  no bread, while others thought that even feeding on the &quot;best
  bread should not be charged against them.&quot; Tea impaired
  the health of many poor, it was thought, while &quot;home-brewed
  beer&quot; would restore it; those who felt most strongly on
  this score insisted that tea was no better than the cheapest
  dram.  Forty years later Harriet Martineau still believed in
  preaching the advantages of dropping the tea habit for the sake
  of relieving pauperism. True, many writers complained of the
  unsettling effects of enclosures; a number of others insisted
  on the damage done to rural employment by the ups and downs of
  manufacturers.  Yet on the whole, the impression prevails that
  pauperism was regarded as a phenomenon sui generis, a social
  disease which was<BR>
  caused by a variety of reasons, most of which became active only
  through the failure of the Poor Law to apply the right remedy.
  (90, 91)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The true answer almost certainly
  was that the aggravation of pauperism and the higher rates were
  due to an increase in what we would today call invisible unemployment.
   Such a fact would not be obvious at a time when even employment
  was, as a rule, invisible, as it necessarily was up to a point
  under cottage industry.  Still there remain these questions:
  how to account for this increase in the number of the unemployed
  and underemployed? and why did the signs of imminent changes
  in industry escape the notice even of observant contemporaries?
  (91)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The explanation lies primarily
  in the excessive fluctuations of trade in early times which tended
  to cover up the absolute increase in trade.  While the latter
  accounted for the rise in employment, the fluctuations accounted
  for the much bigger rise in unemployment.  But while the increase
  in the general level of employment was slow, the increase in
  unemployment and underemployment would tend to be fast.  Thus
  the building up of what Friedrich Engels called the industrial
  reserve army outweighed by much the creation of the industrial
  army proper. (91)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This had the important consequence
  that the connection between unemployment and the rise of total
  trade could be easily overlooked.  While it was often remarked
  that the rise in unemployment was due to the great fluctuations
  in trade, it escaped notice that these fluctuations formed part
  of an underlying process of even greater amplitude, namely, a
  general growth of commerce increasingly based on manufactures.
   For the contemporaries, there seemed to be no connection between
  the mainly urban manufactories and the great increase of the
  poor in the countryside. The increase in the aggregate of trade
  naturally swelled the volume of employment while territorial
  division of labor combined with sharp fluctuations of trade was
  responsible for the severe dislocation of both village and town
  occupations, which resulted in the rapid growth of unemployment.
   The distant rumor of large wages made the poor dissatisfied
  with those which agriculture could afford, and it created a dislike
  for that labor as poorly<BR>
  recompensed.  The industrial regions of that age resembled a
  new country, like another America, attracting immigrants by the
  thousands.  Migration is usually accompanied by a very considerable
  remigration.  That such a reflux towards the village must have
  taken place seems to find support also in the fact that no absolute
  decrease of the rural population was noted.  Thus a cumulative
  unsettling of the population was proceeding as different groups
  were drawn for varying periods into the sphere of commercial
  and manufactural employment, and then left to drift back to their
  original rural habitat. (92)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Much of the social damage done
  to England's countryside sprang at first from the dislocating
  effects of trade directly upon the countryside itself.  The Revolution
  in Agriculture definitely antedated the Industrial Revolution.
   Both enclosures of the common and consolidations into compact
  holdings, which accompanied the new great advance in agricultural
  methods, had a powerfully unsettling effect.  The war on cottages,
  the absorption of cottage gardens and grounds, the confiscation
  of rights in the common deprived cottage industry of its two
  mainstays: family earnings and agricultural background.  As long
  as domestic industry was supplemented by the facilities and amenities
  of a garden plot, a scrap of land, or grazing rights, the dependence
  of the laborer on money earnings was not absolute; the potato
  plot or &quot;stubbling geese,&quot; a cow or even an ass in
  the commons made all the difference; and family earnings acted
  as a kind of unemployment insurance.  The rationalization of
  agriculture inevitably uprooted<BR>
  the laborer and undermined his social security.(92)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the urban scene the effects
  of the new scourge of fluctuating employment were, of course,
  manifest.  Industry was generally regarded as a blind alley occupation.
   &quot;Workmen who are today fully employed may be tomorrow in
  the streets begging for bread ...,&#148; wrote David Davies and
  added: &quot;Uncertainty of labor conditions is the most vicious
  result of these new innovations.&quot; &quot;When a Town employed
  in a Manufactory is deprived of it, the inhabitants are as it
  were struck with a palsy, and become instantly a rent-charge
  upon the Parish; but the mischief does not die with that generation.&#148;
  For in the meantime division of labor wreaks its vengeance: the
  unemployed artisan returns in vain to his village for &quot;the
  weaver can turn his hand to nothing.&quot; The fatal irreversibility
  of urbanization hinged upon this simple fact which Adam Smith
  foresaw when he described the industrial worker as intellectually
  the inferior of the poorest tiller of the soil, for the latter
  can usually take himself to any job.  Still, up to the time Adam
  Smith published his Wealth of Nations pauperism was not increasing
  alarmingly. (92)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the next two decades the picture
  suddenly changed.  In his Thoughts &amp; Details on Scarcity,
  which Burke submitted to Pitt in1795, the author admitted that
  in spite of the general progress there had been a &quot;last
  bad cycle of twenty years.&quot; Indeed, in the decade following
  upon the Seven Years' War (1763) unemployment increased noticeably,.as
  the rise in outdoor relief showed.  It happened for the first
  time that a boom in trade was remarked to have been accompanied
  by signs of growing distress of the poor.  This apparent contradiction
  was destined to become to the next generation of Western humanity
  the most perplexing of all the recurrent phenomena in social
  life.  The specter of overpopulation was beginning to haunt people's
  minds.  William Townsend warned in his Dissertation on the Poor
  Laws: &quot;Speculation apart, it is a fact, that in England,
  we have more than we can feed, and many more than we can profitably
  employ under the present system of law.&quot; Adam Smith, in
  1776, had been<BR>
  reflecting the mood of quiet progress.  Townsend, writing only
  ten years ater,was already conscious of a groundswell. (92, 93)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">However, many things had to happen
  before (only five years later) a man as removed from politics,
  as successful, and as matter-of-fact as the Scotch bridgebuilder,
  Telford, could burst forth with the bitter complaint that little
  change is to be expected from the ordinary course of government,
  and that revolution was the only hope.  A single copy of Paine's
  Rights of Man mailed by Telford to his home village caused a
  riot to break out there.  Paris was catalyzing the European fermentation.(93)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In Canning's conviction the Poor
  Law saved England from a revolution.  He was primarily thinking
  of the 1790's and the French Wars.  The new outburst of enclosures
  further depressed the standards of the poor in the countryside.
   J. H. Clapham, an apologist of these enclosures, conceded that
  the &quot;coincidence of the area in which wages were most systematically
  augmented from the rates with the area of maximum recent enclosures
  is striking.&quot; In other words, but for aid-in-wages the poor
  would have sunk below the starvation level in wide areas of rural
  England.  Rick burning was rampant.  The Popgun Plot found wide
  credence.  Rioting was frequent; rumors of rioting very much
  more so.  In Hampshire -  and not there alone  - the Courts threatened
  death for any attempt at &quot;forcibly lowering the price of
  commodities, either at market or on the road&quot; ; yet simultaneously,
  the magistrates of that same county urgently pressed for the
  general granting of subsidies to wages.  Clearly, the time for
  preventive action had come. (93)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But why, of all courses of action,
  was that one chosen which appeared later as the most impracticable
  of all?  Let us consider the situation and the interests involved.
   Squire and parson ruled the village. Townsend summed up the
  situation by saying that the landed gentleman keeps manufactures
  &quot;at a convenient distance&quot; because &quot;he considers
  that manufactures fluctuate; that the benefit which he is to
  derive from them will not bear proportion with the burthen which
  it must entail upon his property....&#148;  The burden consisted
  mainly in two seemingly contradictory effects of manufactures,
  namely, the increase in pauperism and the rise in wages.  But
  the two were contradictory only if the existence of a competitive
  labor market was assumed, which would, of course, have tended
  to diminish unemploymcnt by reducing the wages of the employed.
   In the absence of such a market - and the Act of Settlement
  was still in force - pauperism and wages might rise simultaneously.
   Under such conditions the &#147;social cost&quot; of urban unemployment
  was mainly borne by the home village to which the out-of-work
  would often repair.  High wages in the towns were a still greater
  burden on rural economy.  Agricultural wages were more than the
  farmer could carry, though less than the laborer could subsist
  on.  It seems clear that agriculture could not compete with town
  wages.  On the other hand, there was general agreement that the
  Act of Settlement should be repealed, or at least loosened, so
  as to help labor to find employment and the employers to find
  laborers.  This, it was felt, would increase the productivity
  of labor all around and, incidentally, diminish the real burden
  of wages.  But the immediate question of the wage differential
  between town and village would obviously become even more<BR>
  pressing for the village by allowing wages to &quot;find their
  own level.&quot; The flux and reflux of industrial employment
  alternating with spasms of unemployment would dislocate rural
  communities more than ever. A dam had to be erected to protect
  the village from the flood of rising wages.  Methods had to be
  found which would protect the rural setting against social dislocation,
  reinforce traditional authority, prevent the draining off of
  rural labor, and raise agricultural wages without overburdening
  the farmer.  Such a device was the Speenhamland Law.  Shoved
  into the turbulent waters of the Industrial Revolution, it was
  bound to create an economic vortex.  However its social implications
  met squarely the situation, as it was judged by the ruling village
  interest - the squire's. (93, 94)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From the point of view of Poor
  Law administration Speenhamland was a grievously retrogressive
  step.  The experience of 250 years had shown that the parish
  was too small a unit for Poor Law administration, since no treatment
  of this matter was adequate which failed to distinguish between
  the able-bodied unemployed on the one hand, the aged, infirm,
  and children on the other.  It was as if a township today attempted
  to deal singlehanded with unemployment insurance, ere mixed up
  with the care for the aged. Accordingly, only in those short
  periods, when the administration of the Poor Law was both national
  and differentiated could it be more or less satisfactory.  Such
  a period was that from 1590 to 1640, under Burleigh and Laud,
  when the Crown handled the Poor Law through the justices of peace,
  and an ambitious scheme of erecting poorhouses, together with
  the enforcement of labor, was initiated.  But the Commonwealth
  (1642-60) destroyed again what was now denounced as the personal
  rule of the Crown, and the Restoration, ironically enough, completed
  the work of the Commonwealth.  The Act of Settlement Of 1662
  restricted the Poor Law to the parish basis, and legislation
  paid but scant attention to pauperism up to the third decade
  of the eighteenth century.  In 1722, at last, efforts at differentiation
  set in; workhouses were to be built by unions of parishes, as
  distinct from local poorhouses; and occasional outdoor relief
  was permitted, as the workhouse would now provide a test of need.
   In 1782, with Gilbert's Act, a long step was taken to expand
  the units of administration by encouraging the setting up of
  parish unions; at that time it was urged that parishes find employment
  for the able-bodied in the neighborhood.  Such a policy was to
  be supplemented by the granting of<BR>
  outdoor relief and even of aid-in-wages, in order to diminish
  the cost of relief  to the able-bodied.  Although the setting
  up of unions of parishes was permissive, not mandatory, it meant
  an advance toward the larger unit of administration and the differentiation
  of the various categories of the relieved poor.  Thus in spite
  of the deficiencies of the system, Gilbert's Act represented
  an attempt in the right direction, and as long as outdoor relief
  and aid-in-wages were merely subsidiary to positive social legislation,
  they need not have been fatal to a rational solution.  Speenhamland
  put a stop to reform.  By making outdoor relief aid-in-wages
  general, it did not (as has been falsely asserted) follow up
  the line of Gilbert's Act, but completely reversed its tendency
  and actually demolished the whole system of the Elizabethan Poor
  Law.  The laboriously established distinction between workhouse
  and poorhouse became. meaningless; the various categories of
  paupers and ablebodied unemployed now tended to fuse into one
  indiscriminate mass of dependent poverty.  The opposite of a
  process of differentiation set in: the workhouse merged into
  the poorhouse, the poorhouse itself tended more and more to disappear;<BR>
  and the parish was again made the sole and final unit in this
  veritable masterpiece of institutional degeneration.(95, 96)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The supremacy of squire and parson
  was even enhanced in consequence of Speenhamland, if such a thing
  was at all possible.  The &quot;undistinguishing benevolence
  of power,&quot; of which the overseers of the poor complained,
  was at its best in that role of &quot;Tory socialism&#148; in
  which the justices of peace swayed the benevolent power, while
  the brunt of the rates was borne by the rural middle class. 
  The bulk of yeomanry had long vanished in the vicissitudes of
  the Agricultural Revolution, and the remaining lifeholders and
  occupying-proprietors tended to merge with the cottagers and
  scrap-holders into one social stratum in the eyes of the potentate
  of the countryside.  He did not too well distinguish between
  needy people, and people who happened to be in need; from the
  lofty heights from which he was watching the struggling life
  of the village there seemed to be no hard and fast line separating
  the poor from the destitute, and he may have been not unduly
  surprised to learn in a bad year that a small fanner was going<BR>
  &quot;on the rates,&quot; after having been ruined by their disastrous
  level.  Surely such cases were not frequent, but their very possibility
  emphasized the fact that many ratepayers were themselves poor.
   On the whole, the relationship of the ratepayer and the pauper
  was somewhat similar to that of the employed and the unemployed
  of our times under various schemes of insurance which make the
  employed bear the burden of keeping the temporarily unemployed.
   Still, the typical ratepayer was usually not eligible for poor
  relief, and the typical agricultural laborer paid no rates. 
  Politically, the squire's pull with the village poor was strengthened
  by Speenhamland while that of the rural middle class was weakened.(95,
  96)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The craziest aspect of the system
  was its economics proper.  The question &quot;Who paid for Speenhamland?&quot;
  was practically unanswerable.  Directly, the main burden fell,
  of course, on the ratepayers.  But the farmers were partly compensated
  by the low wages they had to pay their laborers - a direct result
  of the Speenhamland system.  Moreover, the farmer was frequently
  remitted a part of his rates, if he was willing to employ a villager
  who would otherwise fall on the rates.  The consequent overcrowding
  of the farmer's kitchen and yard with unnecessary hands, some
  of them not too keen performers, had to be set down on the debit
  side.  The labor of those who were actually on the rates was
  to be had even more cheaply.  They had often to work as &quot;roundsmen&quot;
  at alternating places, being paid only their food, or being put
  up for auction in the village &quot;pound&#148;, for a few pence
  a day.  How much this kind of indented labor was worth is another
  question.  To top it all, aids-in-rent were sometimes allowed
  to the poor, while the unscrupulous proprietor of the cottages
  made money by rack-renting the unsanitary habitations; the village
  authorities were likely to close an eye as long as the rates
  for the hovels continued to be turned in.  That such a tangle
  of interests would undermine any sense of financial responsibility
  and encourage every kind of petty corruption is evident. (96,

  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Still, in a broader sense, Speenhamland
  paid.  It was started aid-in-wages, ostensibly benefiting the
  employees, but actually using public means to subsidize the employers.
   For the main effect of the allowance system was to depress wages
  below the subsistence level.  In the thoroughly pauperized areas,
  farmers did not care to employ agncultural laborers who still
  owned a scrap of land, &quot;because none with property was eligible
  for parish relief and the standard wage was so low that, without
  relief of some sort, it was insufficient for a married man.&quot;
  Consequently, in some areas only those people who were on the
  rates had a chance of employment; those who tried to keep off
  the rates and earn a living by their own exertions were hardly
  able to secure a job.  Yet in the country at large the great
  majority must have been of the latter sort and on each of them
  employers as a class made an extra profit since they benefited
  from the lowness of wages  without having to make up for it from
  the rates.  In the long run, a system as uneconomical as that
  was bound to affect the productivity of labor and to depress
  standard wages, and ultimately even the &quot;scale&quot; set
  by the magistrates for the benefit of the poor. By the 1820&#146;s
  the scale of bread was actually being whittled down in various
  counties, and the wretched incomes of the poor were reduced even
  further.  Between 1815 and 1830 the Speenhamland scale, which
  was fairly equal all over the country, was reduced by almost
  one-third (this fall also was practically universal).  Clapham
  doubts whether the total burden of the rates was as severe as
  the rather sudden outburst of complaints would have made one
  believe.  Rightly.  For although the rise in the rates was spectacular
  and in some regions must have been felt as a calamity, it seems
  most probable that it was not so much the burden itself as rather
  the economic effect of aid-in-wages on. the productivity of labor
  that was at the root of the trouble.  Southern England, which
  was most sorely hit, paid out in poor rates not quite 3.3 per
  cent of its income - a very tolerable charge. Clapham thought,
  in view of the fact that a considerable part of this sum &quot;ought
  to have gone to the poor in wages.&quot; Actually, total rates
  were falling steadily in the 1830&#146;s, and their relative
  burden must have even more quickly decreased in view of the growing
  national welfare.  In 1818 the sums actually spent on the relief
  of the poor totaled near eight million pounds; they fell almost
  continuously until they were less than six million in 1826, while
  national income was rising rapidly.  And yet the criticism of
  Speenhamland became more and more violent owing to the fact,
  so it appears, that the dehumanization of the masses began to
  paralyze national life, and notably to constrain the energies
  of industry itself. (97, 98)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Speenhamland precipitated a social
  catastrophe.  We have become accustomed to discount the lurid
  presentations of early capitalism as &#147;sob-stuff.&quot; For
  this there is no justification.  The picture drawn by Harriet
  Martineau, the perfervid apostle of Poor Law Reform, coincides
  with that of the Chartist propagandists who were leading the
  outcry against the Poor Law Reform.  The facts set out in the
  famous Report of the Commission on the Poor Law (1834), advocating
  the immediate repeal of the Speenhamland Law, could have served
  as the material for Dickens' campaign against the Commission's
  policy. Neither Charles Kingsley nor Friedrich Engels, neither
  Blake nor Carlyle, was mistaken in believing that the very image
  of man had been defiled by some terrible catastrophe.  And more
  impressive even than the outbursts of pain and anger that came
  from poets and philanthropists was the icy silence with which
  Malthus and Ricardo passed over the scenes out of which their
  philosophy of secular perdition<BR>
  was born.(98)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Undoubtedly, the social dislocation
  caused by the machine and the circumstances under which man was
  now condemned to serve it had many results that were unavoidable.
   England's rural civilization was lacking in those urban surroundings
  out of which the later industrial towns of the Continent grew.
   There was in the new towns no settled urban middle class, no
  such nucleus of artisans and craftsmen, of respectable petty
  bourgeois and townspeople as could have served as an assimilating
  medium for the crude laborer who attracted by high wages or chased
  from the land by tricky enclosers - was drudging in the early
  mills.  The industrial town of the Midlands and the North West
  was a cultural wasteland; its slums merely reflected its lack
  of tradition and civic self-respect.  Dumped into this bleak
  slough of misery, the immigrant peasant, or even the former yeoman
  or copyholder was soon transformed into a nondescript animal
  of the mire.  It was not that he was paid too little, or even
  that he labored too long - though either happened often to excess
  - but that he was now existing under physical conditions which
  denied the human shape of life.  Negroes of the African forest
  who found themselves caged, panting<BR>
  for air in the hull of a slave trader might have felt as these
  people felt.  And yet all this was not irremediable.  As long
  as a man had a status to hold on to, a pattern set by his kin
  or fellows he could fight for it, and regain his soul.  But in
  the case of the laborer this could happen only in one way: by
  his constituting himself the member of a new class.  Unless he
  was able to make a living by his own labor, he was not a worker
  but a pauper.  To reduce him artificially to such a condition
  was the supreme abomination of Speenhamland.  This act, of an
  ambiguous humanitarianism prevented laborers from constituting
  themselves an economic class and thus deprived them of the only
  means of staving off the fate to which they were doomed in the
  economic mill. (98, 99)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Speenhamland was an unfailing
  instrument of popular demoralization.  If a human society is
  a self-acting machine for maintaining the standards on which
  it is built, Speenhamland was an automaton for demolishing the
  standards on which any kind of society could be based.  Not only
  did it put a premium on the shirking of work and the pretense
  of inadequacy, but it increased the attraction of pauperism precisely
  at the juncture when a man was straining to escape the fate of
  the destitute.  Once a man was in the poorhouse (he would usually
  land there if he and his family had been for some time on the
  rates) he was trapped, and could rarely leave it.  The decencies
  and self respect of centuries of settled life wore off quickly
  in the promiscuity of the poorhouse, where a man had to be cautious
  not to be thought better off than his neighbor, lest he be forced
  to start out on the hunt for work, instead of &quot;boondoggling&quot;
  in the familiar fold,.  &quot;The poorrate had become public
  spoil. . . . To obtain their share the brutal bullied the administrators,
  the profligate exhibited their bastards which must be fed, the
  idle folded their arms and waited till they got it; ignorant
  boys and girls married upon it; poachers, thieves and prostitutes
  extorted it by intimidation; country justices lavished it for
  popularity, and Guardians for convenience.  This was the way
  the fund went....&quot;  Instead of the proper number of laborers
  to till his land - laborers paid by himself - the farmer was
  compelled to take double the number, whose wages were paid partly
  out of the rates; and these men, being employed by compulsion
  on him, were beyond his control - worked or not as they chose
  - let down the quality of his land, and disabled him from employing
  the better men who would have toiled hard for independence. 
  These better men sank down amongst the worst; the rate paying
  cottager, after a vain struggle, went to the pay table to seek
  relief......... &#147; Thus Harriet Martineau. Bashful later-day
  liberals ungratefully neglected the memory of this outspoken
  apostle of their creed.  Yet even her exaggerations, which they
  now feared, put the highlights in the right place.  She herself
  belonged to that struggling middle class, whose genteel poverty
  made them only the more sensitive to the moral intricacies of
  the Poor Law.  She understood and clearly expressed the need
  of society for a new class, a class of &quot;independent laborers.&quot;
  They were the heroes of'her dreams, and she makes one of them
  - a chronically unemployed laborer who refuses to go on relief
  - say proudly to a colleague who decides to go on the rates:
  &quot;Here I stand, and defy anybody to despise me.  I could
  set my children into the middle of the church aisle and dare
  anyone to taunt at them about the place they hold in society.
   There may be some wiser; there may be many richer; but there
  are none more honorable.&quot; The big men of the ruling class
  were still far from comprehending the need for this new class.
   Miss Martineau pointed to &quot;the vulgar error of the aristocracy,
  of supposing only one class of society to exist below that wealthy
  one with which they are compelled by their affairs to have business.&quot;
  Lord Eldon, she complained, like others who must know better,
  &quot;included under one head ['the lower classes'] everybody
  below the wealthiest bankers - manufacturers, tradesmen, artisans,
  laborers and paupers. . . .&quot; ' But it was the distinction
  between these last two, she passionately insisted, that the future
  of society depended upon.  &quot;Except the distinction between
  sovereign and subject, there is no social difference in England
  so wide as that between the independent laborer and the pauper;
  and it is equally ignorant, immoral, and impolitic to confound
  the two,&quot; she wrote.  This, of course, was hardly a statement
  of fad; the difference between the two strata had become nonexistent
  under Speenhamland.  Rather it was a statement of policy based
  upon a prophetic anticipation.  The policy was that of the Poor
  Law Reform Commissioners; the prophecy looked to a free competitive
  labor market and the consequent emergence of an industrial proletariat.
   The abolishment of Speenhamland was the true birthday of the
  modern working class, whose immediate self-interest destined
  them to become the protectors of society against the intrinsic
  dangers of a machine civilization.  But whatever the future had
  in store for them, working class and market economy appeared
  in history together. The hatred of public relief, the distrust
  of state action, the insistence on respectability and self reliance,
  remained for generations characteristics of the British worker.

  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The repeal of Speenhamland was
  the work of a new class entering on the historical scene, the
  middle classes of England.  Squirearchy could not do the job
  these classes were destined to perform: the transformation of
  society into a market economy.  Dozens of laws were repealed
  and others enacted before that transformation was on the way.
   The Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832 disfranchised the rotten
  boroughs and gave power in the Commons once and for all to commoners.
   Their first great act of reform was the abolishing of Speenhamland.
   Now that we realize the degree to which its paternalist methods
  were merged with the life of the country, we will understand
  why even the most radical supporters of reform hesitated to suggest
  a shorter period than ten or fifteen years for the transition.
   Actually, it took place with an abruptness which makes nonsense
  of the legend of English gradualism fostered at a later time
  when arguments against radical reform were sought.  The brutal
  shock of that event haunted for generations the daydreams of
  the British working class.  And yet the success of this lacerating
  operation was due to the deep-seated convictions of the broad
  strata of the population, including the laborers themselves,
  that the system which to all appearances supported them was in
  truth despoiling them, and that the &quot;right to lives&#148;
  was the sickness unto death.(101)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The new law provided that in
  the future no outdoor relief should be given.  Its administration
  was national and differentiated.  In this respect also it was
  a thoroughgoing reform.  Aid-in-wages was, of course, discontinued.
   The workhouse test was reintroduced, but in a new sense.  It
  was now left to the applicant to decide whether he was so utterly
  destitute of all means that he would voluntarily repair to a
  shelter which was deliberately made into a place of horror. 
  The workhouse was invested with a stigma; and staying in it was
  made a psychological and moral torture, while complying with
  the requirements of hygiene and decency - indeed, ingeniously
  using them as a pretense for further deprivations.  Not the justices
  of peace, nor local overseers, but wider authorities - the guardians
  - were to<BR>
  administer the law under dictatorial central supervision.  The
  very burial of a pauper was made an act by which his f fellow
  men renounced solidarity with him even in death. (101, 102)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In 1834 industrial capitalism
  was ready to be started, and Poor Law Reform was ushered in.
   The Speenhamland Law which had sheltered rural England, and
  thereby the laboring population in general, from the full force
  of the market mechanism was eating into the marrow of society.
   By the time of its repeal huge masses of the laboring population
  resembled more the specters that might haunt a nightmare than
  human beings.  But if the workers were physically dehumanized,
  the owning classes were morally degraded.  The traditional unity
  of a Christian society was giving place to a denial of responsibility
  on the part of the well-to-do for the conditions of their fellows.
   The Two Nations were taking shape.  To the bewilderment of thinking
  minds, unheard-of wealth turned out to be inseparable<BR>
  from unheard-of-poverty.  Scholars proclaimed in unison that
  a science had been discovered which put the laws governing man's
  world beyond any doubt.  It was at the behest of these laws that
  compassion was removed from the hearts, and a stoic determination
  to renounce human solidarity in the name of the greatest happiness
  of the greatest number gained the dignity of secular religion.(102)</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The mechanism of the market was
  asserting itself and clamoring for its completion: human labor
  had to be made a commodity.  Reactionary paternalism had in vain
  tried to resist this necessity.  Out of the horrors of Speenhamland
  men rushed blindly for the shelter of a utopian market economy.
