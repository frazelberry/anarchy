SOCIETY</FONT></I></P>

<P>WHEN THE SIGNIFICANCE of poverty was realized, the stage was
set for the nineteenth century. The watershed lay somewhere around
1780. In Adam Smith's great work poor relief was no problem as
yet; only a decade later it was raised as a broad issue in Townsend's
Dissertation on the Poor Laws and never ceased to occupy men's
minds for another century and a half. (111)</P>

<P>The change of atmosphere from Adam Smith to Townsend was, indeed,
striking. The former marked the close of an age which opened with
the inventors of the state, Thomas More and Machiavelli, Luther
and Calvin; the latter belonged to that nineteenth century in
which Ricardo and Hegel discovered from opposite angles the existence
of a society that was not subject to the laws of the state, but,
on the contrary, subjected the state to its own laws. Adam Smith,
it was true treated material- wealth as a separate field of study;
to have done so with a great sense of realism made him the founder
of a new science economics. For all that, wealth was to him merely
an aspect of the life of the community, to the purposes of which
it remained subordinate; it was an appurtenance of the nations
struggling for survival in history and could not be dissociated
from them. In his view, one set of conditions which governed the
wealth of nations derived from the improving, stationary, or declining
state of the country as<BR>
a whole; another set derived from the paramountcy of safety and
security as well as the needs of the balance of power; still another
was given by the policy of the government as it favored town or
countryside, industry or agriculture; hence, it was only within
a given political framework that he deemed it possible to formulate
the question of wealth, by which he for one meant the material
welfare of &quot;the great body of the people.&quot; There is
no intimation in his work that the economic interests of the capitalists
laid down the law to society; no intimation that they were the
secular spokesmen of the divine providence which governed the
economic world as a separate entity. The economic sphere, with
him, is not yet subject to laws of its own that provide us with
a standard of good and evil. (111, 112)</P>

<P>Smith wished to regard the wealth of the nations as a function
of their national life, physical and moral; that is why his naval
policy fitted in so well with Cromwell's Navigation Laws and his
notions of human society harmonized with John Locke's system of
natural rights. In his view nothing indicates the presence of
an economic sphere in society that might become the source of
moral law and political obligation. Self-interest merely prompts
us to do what, intrinsically, will also benefit others, as the
butcher's self-interest will ultimately supply us with a dinner.
A broad optimism pervades Smith's thinking since the laws governing
the economic part of the universe are consonant with man's destiny
as are those that govern the rest. No hidden hand tries to impose
upon us the rites of cannibalism in the name of self-interest.
The dignity of man is that of a moral being, who is, as such,
a member of the civic order of family, state, and &quot;the great
Society of mankind.&quot; Reason and humanity set a limit to piecework;
emulation and gain must give way to them. Natural is that which
is in accordance with the principles embodied in the mind of man;
and the natural order is that which is in accordance with those
principles. Nature in the physical sense was consciously excluded
by Smith from the problem of wealth. &quot;Whatever be the soil,
climate or extent of territory of any particular nation, the abundance
or scantiness of its annual supply, must,.in that particular situation,
depend upon two circumstances,&quot; namely, the skill of labor
and the proportion between the useful and the idle members in
society. Not the natural, but only the human factors enter. This
exclusion of the biological and geographical factor in the very
beginning of his book was deliberate. The fallacies of the Physiocrats
served him as a warning; their predilection for agriculture tempted
them to confuse physical nature with man's nature, and induced
them to argue that the soil alone was truly creative. Nothing
was further from the mind of Smith than such a glorification of
Physis. Political economy should be a human science; it should
deal with that which was natural to man, not to Nature. (112)</P>

<P>Townsend's Dissertation, ten years afterwards, centered on
the theorem of the goats and the dogs. The scene is Robinson Crusoe's
island in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Chile. On this island
Juan Fernandez landed a few goats to provide meat in case of future
visits. The goats had multiplied at a Biblical rate and became
a convenient store of food for the privateers, mostly English,
who were molesting Spanish trade. In order to destroy them, the
Spanish authoritics landed a dog and a bitch, which also, in the
course of time, greatly multiplied, and diminished the number
of goats on which they fed. &quot;Then a new kind of balance was
restored,&quot; wrote Townsend. &quot;The weakest of both species
were among the first to pay the debt of nature; the most active
and vigorous preserved their lives.&quot; To which he added: &quot;It
is the quantity of food which regulates the number of the human
species.&quot; (112, 113)</P>

<P>We note that a search (Cf. Antonio de UIloa, Wafer, William
Funnell, as well as Isaac James (which also contains Captain Wood
Rogers' account on Alexander Selkirk) and the observations of
Edward Cooke) in the sources failed to authenticate the story.
Juan Fernandez duly landed the goats; but the legendary dogs were
described by William Funnell as beautiful cats, and neither dogs
nor cats are known to have multiplied; also the goats were inhabiting
inaccessible rocks, while the beaches - on this all reports agree
- were teeming with fat seals which would have been a much more
engaging prey for the wild dogs. However,<BR>
the paradigm is not dependent upon empirical support. Lack of
antiquarian authenticity can detract nothing from the fact that
Malthus and Darwin owed their inspiration to this source - Malthus
learnt of it from Condorcet, Darwin from Malthus. Yet neither
Darwin's theory of natural selection, nor Malthus' population
laws might have exerted any appreciable influence on modern society
but for the following maxims which Townsend deduced from his goats
and dogs and wished to have applied to the reform of the Poor
Law: &quot;Hunger will tame the fiercest animals, it will teach
decency and civility, obedience and subjection, to the most perverse.
In general it is only hunger which can spur and goad them [the
poor] on to labor; yet our laws have said they shall never hunger.
The laws, it must be confessed, have likewise said, they shall
be compelled to work. But then legal constraint is attended with
much trouble, violence and noise; creates ill will, and never
can be productive of good and acceptable service: whereas hunger
is not only peaceable, silent, unremitting pressure, but, as the
most natural motive to industry and labor, it calls forth the
most powerful exertions; and, when satisfied by the free bounty
of another, lays lasting and sure foundations for good will and
gratitude. The slave must be compelled to work but the free man
should be left to his own judgment, and discretion; should be
protected in the full enjoyment of his own, be it much or little;
and punished when he invades his neighbor's property.&quot; (113,
114)</P>

<P><!--SELECTION--><A NAME="anchor48774"></A><!--/SELECTION-->Here
was a new starting point for political science. By approaching
human community from the animal side, Townsend by-passed the supposedly
unavoidable question as to the foundations of government; and
in doing so introduced a new concept of law into human affairs,
that of the laws of Nature. Hobbes' geometrical bias, as well
as Hume's and Hartley's, Quesnay's and Helvetius' hankering after
Newtonian laws in society had been merely metaphorical: they were
burning to discover a law as universal in society as gravitation
was in Nature, but they thought of it as a human law - for instance,
a mental force such as fear with Hobbes, association in Hartley's
psychology, self-interest with Quesnay, or the quest for utility
with Helvetius. There was no squeamishness about it: Quesnay like
Plato occasionally took the breeder's view of man and Adam Smith
did certainly not ignore the connection between real wages and
long-run supply of labor. However, Aristotle had taught that only
gods or<BR>
beasts could live outside society, and man was neither. To Christian
thought also the chasm between man and beast was constitutive;
no excursions into the realm of physiological facts could confuse
theology about the spiritual roots of the human commonwealth.
If, to Hobbes, man was as wolf to man, it was because outside
of society men behaved like wolves, not because there was any
biological factor which men and wolves had in common. Ultimately,
this was so because no human community had yet been conceived
of which was not identical with law and government. But on the
island of Juan Fernandez there was neither government nor law;
and yet there was balance between goats and dogs. That balance
was maintained by the difficulty the dogs found in devouring the
goats which fled into the rocky part of the island, and the inconveniences
the goats had to face when moving to safety from the dogs. No
government was needed to maintain this balance; it was restored
by the pangs of hunger on the one hand, the scarcity of food on
the other. Hobbes had argued the need for a despot because men
were like beasts; Townsend insisted that they were actually beasts
and that, precisely for that reason, only a minimum of government
was required. From this novel point of view, a free society could
be regarded as consisting of two races: property owners and laborers.
The number of the latter was limited by the amount of food; and
as long as property was safe, hunger would drive them to work.
No magistrates were necessary, for hunger was a better disciplinarian
than the magistrate. To<BR>
appeal to him, Townsend pungently remarked, would be &quot;an
appeal from the stronger to the weaker authority.&quot; (114,
115)</P>

<P>The new foundations closely fitted the society that was emerging.
Since the middle of the eighteenth century national markets had
been developing; the price of grain was no longer local, but regional;
this presupposed the almost general use of money and a wide marketability
of goods. Market prices and incomes, including rents and wages,
showed considerable stability. The Physiocrats were the first
to note these regularities, which they could not even theoretically
fit into a whole as feudal incomes were still prevalent in France,
and labor was often semiservile, so that neither rents nor wages
were, as a rule, determined in the market. But the English countryside
in Adam Smith's time had become part and parcel of a commercial
society; the rent due to the landlord as well as the wages of
the agricultural laborer showed a marked dependence on prices.
Only exceptionally were wages,or prices fixed by the authorities.
And yet in this curious new order the old classes of society continued
to exist more or<BR>
less in their former hierarchy, notwithstanding the disappearance
of their legal privileges and disabilities. Though no law constrained
the laborer to serve the farmer, nor the farmer to keep the landlord
in plenty, laborers and farmers acted as if such compulsion existed.
By what law was the laborer ordained to obey a master, to whom
he was bound by no legal bond? What force kept the classes of
society apart as if they were different kinds of human beings?
And what maintained balance and order in this human collective
w hich neither invoked nor even tolerated the intervention of,
political government? (115)</P>

<P>The paradigm of the goats and the dogs seemed to offer an answer.
The biological nature of man appeared as the given foundation
of a society that was not of a political order. Thus it came to
pass that economists presently relinquished Adam Smith's humanistic
foundations, and incorporated those of Townsend. Malthus&#146;
population law and the law of diminishing returns as handled by
Ricardo made the fertility of man and soil constitutive elements
of the new realm the existence of which had been uncovered. Economic
society had emerged as distinct from the political state. (115)</P>

<P>The circumstances under which the existence of this human aggregate
- a complex society - became apparent were of the utmost importance
for the history of nineteenth century thought. Since the emerging
society was no other than the market system, human society was
now in danger of being shifted to foundations utterly foreign
to the moral world of which the body politic hitherto had formed
part. The apparently insoluble problem of pauperism was forcing
Malthus and Ricardo to endorse Townsend's lapse into naturalism.(115,
116)</P>

<P>Burke approached,,the issue of pauperism squarely from the
angle of public security. Conditions in the West Indies convinced
him of the danger of nurturing a large slave population without
any adequate provision for the safety of the white masters especially
as the Negroes were often allowed to go armed. Similar considerations,
he thought, applied to the increase of the number of the unemployed
at home, seeing that the government had no police force at its
disposal. Although an out-and-out defender of patriarchal traditions,
he was a passionate adherent of economic liberalism, in which
he saw the answer to the burning administrative problem of pauperism.
Local authorities were gladly taking advantage of the unexpected
demand of the cotton mills for destitute children whose apprenticing
was left to the care of the parish. Many hundreds were indented
with manufacturers, often in distant parts of the country. Altogether
the new towns developed a healthy appetite for paupers; factories
were even prepared to pay for the use of the poor. Adults were
assigned to any employer who would take them for their keep; just
as they would be billeted out in turn amongst the farmers of the
parish, in one or another form of the roundsman system. Farming
out was cheaper than the running of &quot;gaols without guilt,&quot;
as workhouses were sometimes called. From the administrative angle
this meant that the &quot;more persistent and more minutely detailed
authority of the employer&quot; (Webb, S. and B., English Local
Government, Vols. VII-IX, &quot;Poor Law History&#148;) took the
place of the govemment's and the parish's enforcement of work.(116)</P>

<P>Clearly, a question of statesmanship was involved. Why should
the poor be made a public charge and their maintenance put on
the parish, if ultimately the parish discharged its obligation
by farming out the able-bodied to the capitalist entrepreneurs,
who were so eager to fill their mills with them that they would
even spend money to obtain their services? Did this not clearly
indicate that there was also a less expensive way of compelling
the poor to earn their keep than the parish way? The solution
lay in the abolishment of the Elizabethan legislation without
replacing it by any other. No assessment of wages, no relief for
the able-bodied unemployed, but no minimum wages either, nor a
safeguarding of the right to live. Labor should be dealt with
as that which it was, a commodity which must find its price in
the market. The laws of commerce were the laws of nature and consequently
the laws of God. What else was this than an appeal from the weaker
magistrate to the stronger, from the justice of the peace to the
all- powerful pangs of hunger? To the politician and administrator
laissez-faire was simply a principle of the ensurance of law and
order, with the minimum cost and effort. Let the market be given
charge of the poor, and things will look after themselves. It
was on this point that Bentham, the rationalist, agreed with Burke,
the traditionalist. The calculus of pain and pleasure required
that no avoidable pain should be inflicted. If hunger would do
the job, no other penalty was needed. To the question, &quot;What
can the law do relative to subsistence?&quot; Bentham answered,
&quot;Nothing, directly.&quot; (Bentham, J., Principles of Civil
Code, Ch. 4. (Bowring, Vol. I, P. 333.)) Poverty was Nature surviving
in society; its physical sanction was hunger. &quot;The force
of the physical sanction being sufficient, the employment of the
political sanction would be superfluous.&quot; (Bentham, J., ibid.)
All,that was needed was the &quot;scientific and economical&quot;
treatment of the poor. (Bentham, J., Observation on the Poor Bill,
1797) Bentham was strongly opposed to Pitt's Poor Law Bill which
would have amounted to an enactment of Speenhamland, as it permitted
both outdoor relief and aid-in-wages. Yet Bentham, unlike his
pupils, was at this time no rigid economic liberal, nor was he
a democrat. His Industry-Houses were a nightmare of minute utilitarian
administration enforced by all the chicanery of scientific management.
He maintained that there always would be a need for them as the
community could not quite disinterest itself in the fate of the
indigent. Bentham believed that poverty was part of plenty. &quot;In
the highest stage of social prosperity,&quot; he said, &quot;the
great mass of the citizens will most probably possess few other
resources than their daily labor, and consequently will always
be near to indigence.....&#148; Hence he recommended that &quot;a
regular contribution should be established for the wants of indigence,&quot;
though thereby &quot;in theory WANT is decreased and thus industry
hit,&quot; as he regretfully added, since from the utilitarian
point of view the task of the government was to increase want
in order to make the physical sanction of hunger effective.(Bentham,
J., Principles of Civil Code, p. 314) (116, 117)</P>

<P>The acceptance of near-indigency of the mass of the citizens
as the price to be paid for the highest stage of prosperity was
accompanied by very different human attitudes. Townsend righted
his emotional balance by indulging in prejudice and sentimentalism.
The improvidence of the poor was a law of nature, for servile,
sordid, and ignoble work would otherwise not be done. Also what
would become of the fatherland unless we could rely on the poor?
&quot;For what is it but distress and poverty which can prevail
upon the lower classes of the people to encounter all the horrors
which await them on the tempestuous ocean or on the field of battle?&quot;
But this display of a rugged patriotism still left room for more
tender sentiments. Poor relief should, of course, be abolished
outright. The Poor Laws &quot;procced from principles which border
on absurdity, as professing to accomplish that which, in the very
nature and constitution of the world, is impracticable.&quot;
But once the indigent were left to the mercy of the<BR>
well-to-do who can doubt that &quot;the only difficulty&quot;
is to restrain the impetuosity of the latter's benevolence? And
are the sentiments of charity not far nobler than those that flow
from hard and fast legal obligations? &quot;Can in nature anything
be more beautiful than the mild complacency of benevolence?&quot;
he cried out, contrasting it with the cold heartlessness of &quot;a
parish pay-table,&quot; which knew not those scenes of an &quot;artless
expression of unfeigned gratitude for unexpected favors. &quot;When
the poor are obliged to cultivate the friendship of the rich,
the rich will never want inclination to relieve th distress of
the poor....&#148; No one who has read this touching portrayal
of the intimate life of the Two Nations can doubt that unconsciously,
it was from the island of the goats and dogs that Victorian England
drew its sentimental education.(118)</P>

<P>Edmund Burke was a man of different stature. Where men like
Townsend failed in a small way, he failed in a great way. His
genius exalted brutal fact into tragedy, and invested sentimentality
with the halo of mysticism. &quot;When we affect to pity as poor
those who must labor or the world cannot exist, we are trifling
with the condition of mankind.&quot; This was undoubtedly better
than coarse indifference, empty lamentations, or the cant of sympathetic
uplift. But the virility of this realistic attitude was impaired
by the subtle complacency with which he spotlighted the scenes
of aristocratic pageantry. The result was to out-Herod Herod,
but to underestimate the chances of timely reform. It is a fair
guess that had Burke lived, the Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832,
which put an end to the ancien regime, would have been passed
only at the cost of an avoidable bloody revolution. And yet, Burke
might have countered, once the masses were fated by the laws of
political economy to toil in misery, what else was the idea of
equality but a cruel bait to goad mankind into self-destruction?
(118, 119)</P>

<P>Bentham possessed neither the sleek complacency of a Townsend
nor the all too precipitate historicism of a Burke. Rather, to
this believer in reason and reform the newly discovered realm
of social law appeared as the coveted no man's land of utilitarian
experimentation. Like Burke, he refused to defer to zoological
determinism, and he too rejected the ascendancy of economics over
politics proper. Though author of the Essay on Usury, and of a
Manual of Political Economy, he was an amateur at that science
and even failed to provide the one great contribution which utilitarianism
might have been expected to make to economics, namely, the discovery
that value derived from utility. Instead, he was induced by associationist
psychology to give rein to his boundless imaginative faculties
as a social engineer. Laissez-faire meant to Bentham only another
device in social mechanics. Social not technical invention was
the intellectual mainspring of the Industrial Revolution. The
decisive contribution of the natural sciences to engineering was
not made until a full century later, when the Industrial Revolution
was long over. To the practical bridge or canal builder, the designer
of machines or engines, knowledge of the general laws of nature
was utterly useless before the new applied sciences in mechanics
and chemistry were developed. Telford, founder and lifelong President
of the Society of Civil Engineers, refused membership m that body
to applicants who had studied physics and, according to Sir David
Brewster, never made himself acquainted with the elements of geometry.
The triumphs of natural science had been theoretical in the true
sense, and could not compare in practical importance with those
of the social sciences of the day. It was to these latter that
the prestige of science as against routine and tradition was due,
and, unbelievable though it may seem to our generation, the standing
of natural science greatly gained by its connection with the human
sciences. The discovery of economics was an astounding revelation
which hastened greatly the transformation of society and the establishment
of a market system, while the decisive machines had been the inventions
of uneducated artisans some of whom could hardly read or write.
It was thus both just and appopriate that not the natural but
the social sciences should rank as the intellectual parents of
the mechanical revolution which subjected the powers of nature
to man. (119)</P>

<P>Bentham himself was convinced that he had discovered a new
social science, that of morals and legislation. It was to be founded
on the principle of utility, which allowed of exact calculation
with the help of associationist psychology. Science, precisely
because it became effective within the circumference of human
affairs, meant in eighteenth century England invariably a practical
art based on empirical knowledge. The need for such a pragmatic
attitude was indeed overwhelming. As statistics were not available
it was often not possible to say whether population was on the
increase or decrease, what the trend of the balance of foreign
trade was, or which class of the population was gaining on the
other. It was frequently a mere matter of guesswork whether the
wealth of the country was waxing or waning, where, the poor came
from, what the situation of credit, of banking, or profits was.
An empirical instead of a purely speculative or antiquarian approach
to matters such as these was what was in the first Place meant
by &#147;science&quot; ; and as practical interests were naturally
paramount, it fell to science to suggest how to regulate and organize
the vast realm of new phenomena. We have seen how puzzled the
Saints were by the nature of poverty, and how ingeniously they
experimented with the forms of self-help; how the notion of profits
was hailed as a cure-all for the most diverse ills; how none could
say whether pauperism was a good or a bad sign; how bewildered
scientific workhouse managements were to find themselves unable
to make money out of the poor; how Owen made his fortune by running
his factories on the lines of a conscious philanthropy; and how
a number of other experiments which seemed to involve the same
technique of enlightened self-help failed pitifully, thus causing
dire perplexity to their philanthropic authors. Had we extended
our purview from pauperism to credit, specie, monopolies, savings.
insurance, investing, public finance or, for that matter, prisons,
education, and lotteries we might have easily adduced as many
ventures in respect to each of them. (120)</P>

<P>With Bentham&#146;s death, approximately, this period comes
to an end; since the 1840's projectors in business were simply
promoters of definite ventures, not any more the alleged discoverers
of new applications of the universal principles of mutuality,
trust, risks, and other elements of human enterprise. Henceforth
businessmen imagined they knew what forms their activities should
take; they rarely inquired into the nature of money before founding
a bank. Social engineers were now usually found only amongst cranks
or frauds, and then often confined behind iron bars. The spate
of industrial and banking systems which from Paterson and John
Law to the Pereires had flooded stock exchanges with the projects
of religious, social, and academic sectarians had now become a
mere trickle. With those engaged in the routine of business, analytical
ideas were at a discount. The exploration of society, at least
so it was thought, was concluded; no white spots were left on
the human map. A man of<BR>
Bentham's stamp had become impossible for a century. Once the
market organization of industrial life had become dominant, all
other institutional fields were subordinated to this pattern;
the genius for social artifacts was homeless. (120, 121)<BR>
Bentham's Panopticon was not only a &quot;mill to grind rogues
honest, and idle men industrious&quot; (Stephen, Sir L., The English
Utilitarians, 1900); it would also pay dividends like those of
the Bank of England. He sponsored proposals as different as an
improved system for patents; limited liability companies; a decennial
census of population; the establishment of a Ministry of Health;
interest-bearing notes to make savings general; a frigidarium
for vegetables and fruit; armament factories on new technical
principles, eventually run by convict labor, or alternatively,
by the assisted poor; a Chrestomathic Day School to teach utilitarianism
to the upper middle classes; a general register of real property;
a system of public account keeping; reforms of public instruction;
uniform registration; freedom from usury; the relinquishment of
colonies; the use of contraceptives to keep the poor rate down;
the junction of the Atlantic and the Pacific by means of a joint
stock company; and others. Some of these projects harbored literally
shoals of minor improvements as, for instance, that on Industry-Houses
which was a congeries of innovations for the betterment and the
exploitation of man based on the achievements of associationist
psychology. While Townsend and Burke linked laissez-faire with
legislative quietism, Bentham saw in it no obstacle to broadsides
of reform. (121)</P>

<P>Before we proceed to the answer which Malthus, in 1798, gave
to Godwin and with which classical economics properly begins,
let us remember the times. Godwin's Political Justice was written
to counter Burke's Reflections on the French Revolution (I790)
It appeared just before the wave of repression started with the
suspension of habeas corpus (1794), and the persecution of the
democratic Correspondence Societies. By this time England was
at war with France and the terreur made the word &quot;democracy&quot;
synonymous with social revolution. Yet the democratic movement
in England which was inaugurated with Dr. Price's &quot;Old Jewry&quot;
sermon (1789) and reached its literary height in Paine's The Rights
of Man (1791) was restricted to the political field; the discontent
of the laboring poor found no echo in it; the question of the
Poor Law was barely mentioned in the pamphlets which raised the
cry for universal suffrage and annual parliaments. Yet actually,
it was in the sphere of the Poor<BR>
Law that the squires' decisive countermove came, in the form of
Speenhamland. The parish retired behind an artificial morass under
the cover of which it outlived Waterloo by twenty years. But while
the evil consequences of the panicky acts of political repression
of the 1790's might have been soon overcome, had they stood alone,
the degenerative process started by Speenhamland left its indelible
mark on the country. The forty years prolongation of squirearchy
which it produced was bought at the price of the sacrifice of
the virility of the common people. &quot;When the owning classes
complained of the poor rate becoming heavier and heavier,&quot;
says Mantoux, &quot;they overlooked the fact that it really amounted
to an insurance against revolution, while the working class, when
they accepted the scanty allowance doled out to them, did not
realize that it was partly obtained by a reduction of their own
legitimate earnings. For the inevitable result of 'allowances'
was to keep wages down to the lowest level, and even to force
them below the limit corresponding to the irreducible needs of
the wage-eamers. The farmer or the manufacturer relied on the
parish to make up the difference between the sum he paid the men
and the sum on which the men could live. For why should they incur
an expense which could so easily befoisted on to the body of the
rate payers? On the other hand, those in receipt of the parish
relief were willling to work for a lower wage, and thus made competition
quite impossible to those who received no parish help. The paradoxical
result arrived at was that the so-called &#145;poor-rate' meant<BR>
an economy for the employers, and a loss for the industrious workman
who expected nothing from public charity. Thus the pitiless interplay
of interests had turned a charitable law into abond of iron&quot;
(Mantoux, P. L., The Industrial Revolution in the Eighteenth Century,
1928) (121, 122)</P>

<P>It was this bond, we submit, on which the new law of wages
and of population rested. Malthus himself, like Burke and Bentham,
was violently opposed to Speenhamland and advocated complete repeal
of the Poor Law. Neither of them had foreseen that Speenhamland
would force wages of the laborer down to subsistence level and
below; on the contrary, they expected that it would force wages
up, or at least maintain them artificially, which, but for the
Anti-Combination Laws, might well have been the case. This false
anticipation helps to explain why the low level of rural wages
was not traced by them<BR>
to Speenhamland, which was its actual cause, but was regarded
as incontrovertible proof of the working of the so-called iron
law of wages. To this foundation of the new economic science we
must now turn. (122, 123)</P>

<P>Townsend's naturalism was doubtless not the only possible basis
for the new science of political economy. The existence of an
economic society was manifest in the regularities of prices, and
the stability of the incomes dependent upon those prices; consequently,
economic law may well have been based directly on prices. What
induced orthodox economics to seek its foundations in naturalism
was the otherwise inexplicable misery of the great mass of the
producers which, as we know today, could never have been deduced
from the laws of the old market. But the facts as they appeared
to contemporaries were roughly these: in times past the laboring
people had habitually lived on the brink of indigence (at least,
if one accounted for changing levels of customary standards) ;
since the coming of the machine they had certainly never risen
above subsistence level; and now that the economic society was
finally taking shape, it was an indubitable fact that decade after
decade the material level of existence of the laboring poor was
not improving a jot, if, indeed, it was not, becoming worse. (123)</P>

<P>If ever the overwhelming evidence of the facts seemed to point
in one direction, it was, therefore, in the case of the iron law
of wages, which asserted that the bare subsistence level on which
laborers actually lived was the result of a law which tended to
keep their wages so low that no other standard was possible for
them. This semblance was, of course, not only misleading but indeed
implied an absurdity from the point of view of any consistent
theory of prices and incomes under capitalism. Yet, in the last
analysis, it was on account of this false appearance that the
law of wages could not be based on any rational rule of human
behavior, but had to be deduced from the naturalistic facts of
the fertility of man and soil, as they were presented to the world
by Malthus' law of population combined with the law of diminishing
returns. The naturalistic element in the foundations of orthodox
economics was the outcome of the conditions primarily created
by Speenhamland. (123)</P>

<P>It follows that neither Ricardo nor Malthus understood the
working of the capitalist system. Not until a century after the
publication of the Wealth of Nations was it clearly realized that
under a market system the factors of production shared in the
product, and as produce increased, their absolute share was bound
to rise. (Cannan, B., A Review of Economic Theory, 1930) Although
Adam Smith had followed Locke's false start on the labor origins
of value, his sense of realism saved him from being consistent.
Hence he had confused views on the elements of price, while justly
insisting that no society can flourish, the members of which,
in their great majority, are poor and miserable. However, what
appears as a truism to us was a paradox in his time. Smith's own
view was that universal plenty could not help percolate down to
the people; it was impossible that society should get wealthier
and wealthier and the people poorer and poorer. Unfortunately,
the facts did not seem to bear him out for a long time to come;
and as theorists had to account for the facts, Ricardo proceeded
to argue that the more society advanced the greater would be the
difficulty of procuring food and the richer would landlords grow,
exploiting both capitalists and workers; that the capitalists'
and the workers' interests were in fatal opposition to one another,
but that this opposition was ultimately ineffective as the workers'
wages could never rise above the subsistence level and profits
were bound to shrivel up in any case. In some remote sense all
these assertions contained an element of truth, but as an explanation
of capitalism nothing more unreal and abstruse could have been
produced. However, the facts themselves were formed on contradictory
patterns and even today we find it difficult to unravel them.
No wonder that the deus ex machine of animal and plant propagation
had to be invoked in a scientific system the authors of which
claimed to deduce the laws of production and distribution from
the behavior not of plants or of animals but of men. (123, 124)</P>

<P>Let us briefly survey the consequences of the fact that the
foundations of economic theory were laid down during the Speenhamland
period, which made appear as a competitive market economy what
actually was capitalism without a labor market. (124)</P>

<P>First, the economic theory of the classical economists was
essentially confused. The parallelism, between wealth and value
introduced the most perplexing pseudo problems into nearly every
department of Ricardian economics. The wage-fund theory, a legacy
of Adam Smith, was a rich source of misunderstandings. Apart from
some special theories like that of rent, taxation, and foreign
trade, where deep insights were gained, the theory consisted of
the hopeless attempt to arrive at categorical conclusions about
loosely defined terms purporting to explain the behavior of prices,
the formation of incomes, the process of production, the influence
of costs on prices, the level of profits, wages, and interest,
most of which remained as obscure as before. (124, 125)</P>

<P>Second, given the conditions under which the problem represented
itself, no other result was possible. No unitary system could
have explained the facts, as they did not form part of any one
system, but were actually the result of the simultaneous action
on the body social of two mutually exclusive systems, namely,
a nascent market economy and a paternalistic regulationism in
the sphere of the most important factor of production, labor.
(125)</P>

<P>Third, the solution hit upon by the classical economists had
the most far-reaching consequences for the understanding of the
nature of economic society. As gradually the laws governing a
market economy were apprehended, these laws were put under the
authority of Nature herself. The law of diminishing returns was
a law of plant physiology. The Malthusian law of population reflected
the relationship between the fertility of man and that of the
soil. In both cases the forces in play were the forces of Nature,
the animal instinct of sex and the growth of vegetation in a given
soil. The principle involved was the same as that in the case
of Townsend's goats and dogs: there was a natural limit beyond
which human beings could not multiply and that limit was set by
the available food supply. Like Townsend, Malthus concluded that
the superfluous specimens would be killed off; while the goats
are killed off by the dogs, the dogs must starve for lack of food.
With Malthus the repressive check consisted in the<BR>
destruction of the supernumerary specimens by the brute forces
of Nature. As human beings are destroyed also by other causes
than starvation - such as war, pestilence, and vice - these were
equated with the destructive forces of Nature. This involved,
strictly, an inconsistency as it made social forces responsible
for achieving the balance required by Nature, a criticism, however,
to which Malthus might have answered that in absence of wars and
vice - that is, in a virtuous community - as many more people
would have to starve as were spared by their peaceful virtues.
Essentially, economic society was founded on the grim realities
of Nature; if man disobeyed the laws which ruled that society,
the fell executioner would strangle the offspring of the improvident.
The laws of a competitive society were put under the sanction
of the jungle. (125)</P>

<P>The true significance off the tormenting problem of poverty
now stood revealed: economic society was subjected to laws which
were not human laws. The rift between Adam Smith and Townsend
had broadened into a chasm; a dichotomy appeared which marked
the birth of nineteenth century consciousness. From this time
onward naturalism haunted the science of man, and the reintegration
of society into the human world became the persistently sought
aim of the evolution of social thought. Marxian economics - in
this line of argument - was an essentially unsuccessful attempt
to achieve that aim, a failure due to Marx's too close adherence
to Ricardo and the traditions of liberal economics. (125, 126)</P>

<P>The classical economists themselves were far from unconscious
of such a need. Malthus and Ricardo were in no way indifferent
to the fate of the poor but their humane concern merely forced
a false theory into even more tortuous paths. The iron law of
wages carried a well known saving clause according to which the
higher the customary needs of the laboring class, the higher the
subsistence level below which not even the iron law could depress
wages. It was this &quot;standard of wretchedness&#148; on which
Malthus set his hopes (Hazlitt, W., A Reply to the Essay on Population
by the Rev. T. A. Maltus in a Series of Letters, 1803), and which
he wished to have raised by every means, for thus alone, he thought,
could those be saved from the lowest forms of wretchedness, who,
by virtue of his law were doomed to be wretched. Ricardo, too,
for the same reason, wished that in all countries the laboring
classes should have a taste for comforts and enjoyments, &quot;and
that they should be stimulated by all legal<BR>
means in their exertions to procure them.&quot; Ironically, in
order to evade the law of nature, men were here enjoined to raise
their own starvation level. And yet, these were undoubtedly sincere
attempts on the part of the classic economists to rescue the poor
from the fate which their very theories helped to prepare for
them.(126)</P>

<P>In the case of Ricardo, theory itself included an element which
counterbalanced rigid naturalism. This element, pervading his
whole system, and firmly grounded in his theory of value, was
the principle of labor. He completed what Locke and Smith had
begun, the humanization of economic value; what the Physiocrats
had credited to Nature, Ricardo reclaimed for man. In a mistaken
theorem of tremendous scope he invested labor with the sole capacity
of constituting value, thereby reducing all conceivable transactions
in economic society to the principle of equal exchange in a society
of free men.(126)</P>

<P>Within Ricardo's system itself the naturalistic and the humanistic
factors coexisted which were contending for supremacy in economic
society. The dynamics of this situation was of overwhelming power.
As its result the drive for a competitive market acquired the
irresistible impetus of a process of Nature. For the self-regulating
market was now believed to follow from the inexorable laws of
Nature, and the unshackling of the market to be an ineluctable
necessity. The creation of a labor market was an act of vivisection
performed on the body of society by such as were steeled to their
task by an assurance which only science can provide. That the
Poor Law must disappear was part of this certainly. &quot;The
principle of gravitation is not more certain than the tendency
of such laws to change wealth and vigor into misery and weakness
. . . until at last all classes should be infected with the plague
of universal poverty,&quot; wrote Ricardo. (Ricardo, D., Principles
of Political Economy and Taxation (ed. Gonner, 1929, p. 86).)He
would have been, indeed, a moral coward who, knowing this, failed
to find the strength to save mankind from itself by the cruel
operation of the abolishment of poor relief. It was on this point
that Townsend, Malthus and Ricardo, Bentham,and Burke were at
one. Fiercely as they differed in method and outlook, they agreed
on opposition to the principles of political economy and to Speenhamland.
What made economic liberalism an irresistible force was this congruence
of opinion between diametrically opposed outlooks; for what the
ultrareformer Bentham and the ultratraditionalist Burke equally
approved of automatically took on the character of self-evidence.
(126, 127)</P>

<P>One man alone perceived the meaning of the ordeal, perhaps
because amongst the leading spirits of the age he alone possessed
intimate practical knowledge of industry and was also open to
inner vision. No thinker ever advanced farther than Robert Owen
did into the realm of industrial society. He was deeply aware
of the distinction between society and state; while harboring
no prejudice against the latter, as Godwin did, he looked to the
state merely for that which it could perform; for helpful intervention
designed to avert harm from the cornmunity, emphatically not for
the organizing of society. In the same way, he nourished no animosity
against the machine the neutral character of which he recognized.
Neither the political mechanism of the state, nor the technological
apparatus of the machine hid from him the phenomenon: society.
He rejected the animalistic approach to society, refuting its
Malthusian and Ricardian limitations. But the fulcrum of his thought
was his turning away from Christianity, Which he accused of &quot;individualization,&quot;
or of fixing the responsibility for character on the individual
himself, thus denying, to Owen's mind, the reality of society
and its all-powerful formative influence upon character. The true
meaning of the attack on &quot;individualization&quot; lay in
his insistence on the social origin of human motives: &quot;Individualized
man, and all that is truly valuable in Christianity, are so separated
as to be utterly incapable of union through all eternity.&quot;
It was Owen's discovery of society which made him transcend Christianity
and reach a position beyond it. He grasped the truth that because
society is real, man must ultimately submit to it. His socialism,
one might say, was based on a reform of human consciousness to
be reached through the recognition of the reality of society.
&quot;Should any of the causes of evil be irremovable by the new
powers which men are about to acquire,&quot; he wrote, &quot;they
will know that they are necessary and unavoidable evils; and childish
unavailing complaints will cease to be made.&quot; (127, 128)</P>

<P>Owen may have nourished an exaggerated notion of those powers;
otherwise he hardly could have suggested to the magistrates of
the County of Lanark that society should be forthwith newly started
from the &quot;nucleus of society&quot; which he had discovered
in his village cornmunities. Such flux of the imagination is the
privilege of the genius, but for whom mankind could not exist
for lack of understanding of itself. All the more significant
was the irremovable frontier of freedom to which he pointed, that
was given by the necessary limits set to the absence of evil in
society. But not until man had transformed society with the help
of the new powers he acquired would this frontier become apparent,
Owen felt; then man would have to accept this frontier in the
spirit of maturity which knows not childish complaint. (128)</P>

<P>Robert Owen, in 18l7, described the course on which Western
man had entered and his words summed up the problem of the coming
century. He pointed to the mighty consequences which proceed from
manufactures, &quot;when left to their natural progress.&quot;
&quot;The general diffusion of manufactures throughout a country
generates a new character in its inhabitants; and as this character
is formed upon a principle quite unfavorable to individual or
general happiness, it will produce the most lamentable and permanent
evils, unless its tendency be counteracted by legislative interference
and direction.&quot; The organization of the whole of society
on the principle of gain and profit must have far-reaching results.
He formulated these results in terms of human character. For the
most obvious effect of the new institutional system was the destruction
of the traditional character of settled populations and their
transmutation into a new type of people, migratory, nomadic, lacking
in self-respect and discipline - crude, callous beings of whom
both laborer and capitalist were an example. He proceeded to the
generalization that the principle involved was unfavorable to
individual and social happiness. Grave evils would be produced
in this fashion unless the tendencies inherent in market institutions
were checked by conscious social direction made effective through
legislation. True, the condition of the laborers which he deplored
was partly the effect of the &quot;allowance system.&quot; But
essentially, what he observed was true of town and village laborers
alike, namely, that &quot;they are at present in a situation infinitely
more degraded and miserable than they were before the introduction
of those manufactories, upon the success of which their bare subsistence
now depends.&quot; Here again, he hit rock bottom, emphasizing
not incomes but degradation and misery. And as the prime cause
of this degradation he, rightly again, pointed to the dependence
for bare subsistence on the factory. He grasped the fact that
what appeared primarily as an economic problem was essentially
a social one. In economic terms the worker was certainly exploited:
he did not get in exchange that which was his due. But important
though this was, it was far from all. In spite of exploitation,
he might have been financially better off than before. But a principle
quite unfavorable to individual and general happiness was working
havoc with his social environment, his neighborhood, his standing
in the community, his craft; in a word, with those relationships
to nature and man in which his economic existence was formerly
embedded. The Industrial Revolution was causing a social dislocation
of stupendous proportions, and the problem of poverty was merely
the economic aspect of this event. Owen justly pronounced that
unless legislative interference and direction counteracted these
devastating forces, great and permanent evils would follow. (128,
129)</P>

<P>He did not, at this time, foresee that the self-protection
of society for which he was calling would prove incompatible with
the functioning of the economic system itself. (129)
