<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Chapter 15, <I>MARKET AND NATURE</I></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>WHAT WE CALL LAND is an element of nature inextricably interwoven
with man's institutions. To isolate it and form a market out of
it was perhaps the weirdest of all undertakings of our ancestors.
(178)</P>

<P>Traditionally, land and labor are not separated; labor forms
part of life, land remains part of nature, life and nature form
an articulate whole. Land is thus tied up with the organizations
of kinship, neighborhood, craft, and crecd-with tribe and temple,
village, gild, and church. One Big Market, on the other hand,
is an arrangement of economic life which includes markets for
the factors of production. Since these factors happen to be indistinguishable
from the elements of human institutions, man and nature, it can
be readily seen that market economy involves a society the institutions
of which are subordinated to the requirements of the market mechanism.
(178)</P>

<P>The proposition is as utopian in respect to land as in respect
to labor. The economic function is but one of many vital functions
of land. It invests man's life with stability; it is the site
of his habitation; it is a condition of his physical safety; it
is the landscape and the seasons. We might as well imagine his
being bom without hands and feet as carrying on his life without
land. And yet to separate land from man and organize society in
such a way as to satisfy the requirements of a real-estate market
was a vital part of the utopian concept of a market economy. (178)</P>

<P>Again, it is in the field of modern colonization that the true
significance of such a venture becomes manifest. Whether the colonist
needs land as a site for the sake of the wealth buried in it,
or whether he merely wishes to constrain the native to produce
a surplus of food and raw materials, is often irrelevant; nor
does it make much difference whether the native works under the
direct supervision of the colonist or only under some form of
indirect compulsion, for in every and any case the social and
cultural system of native life must be first shattered. (178)</P>

<P>There is close analogy between the colonial situation today
and that of Western Europe a century or two ago. But the mobilization
of land which in exotic regions may be compressed into a few years
or decades may have taken as many centuries in Western Europe.
(178, 179)</P>

<P>The challenge came from the growth of other than purely commercial
forms of capitalism. There was, starting in England with the Tudors,
argricultural capitalism with its need for an individualized treatrnent
of the land, including conversions and enclosures. There was industrial
capitalism which - in France as in England - was primarily rural
and needed sites for its mills and laborers' settlements, since
the beginning of the eighteenth century. Most powerful of all,
though affecting more the use of the land than its ownership,
there was the rise of industrial towns with their need for practically
unlimited food and raw material supplies in the nineteenth century.
(179)</P>

<P>Superficially, there was little likeness in the responses to
these challenges, yet they were stages in the subordination of
the surface of the planet to the needs of an industrial society.
The first stage was the commercialization of the soil, mobilizing
the feudal revenue of the land. The second was the forcing up
of the production of food and organic raw materials to serve the
needs of a rapidly growing industrial population on a national
scale. The third was the extension of such a system of surplus
production to overseas and colonial territories. With this last
step land and its produce were finally fitted into the scheme
of a self-regutating world market.(179)</P>

<P>Commercialization of the soil was only another name for the
liquidation of feudalism which started in Western urban centers
as well as in England in the fourteenth century and was concluded
some five hundred years later in the course of the European revolutions,
when the remnants of villeinage were abolished. To detach man
from the soil meant the dissolution of the body economic into
its elements so that each element could fit into that part of
the system where it was most useful. The new system was first
established alongside the fold which it tried to assimilate and
absorb, by securing a grip on such soil as was still bound up
in precapitalistic ties. The feudal sequestration of the land
was abolished. &quot;The aim was the elimination of all claims
on the part of neighborhood or kinship organizations, especially
those of virile aristocratic stock as well as of the Church -
claims, which exempted land from commerce or mortgage.&quot; (Brinkmann,
C., &quot;Das soziale System des Kapitalismus,&quot; Grundriss
der Soziale System des Ekonomik, 1924). Some of this was achieved
by individual force and violence, some by revolution from above
or below, some by war and conquest, some by legislative action,
some by administrative pressure, some by spontaneous small-scale
action of private persons over long stretches of time. Whether
the dislocation was swiftly healed or whether it caused an open
wound in the body social depended primarily on the measures taken
to regulate the process. Powerful factors of change and adjustment
were introduced by the governments themselves. Secularization
of Church lands, for instance, was one of the fundaments of the
modern state up to the time of the Italian Risorgimento and, incidentally,
one of the chief means of the ordered transference of land into
the hands of private individuals. (179, 180)</P>

<P>The biggest single steps were taken by the French Revolution
and by the Benthamite reforms of the 183o's and 1840's - &quot;The
condition most favorable to the prosperity of agriculture exists,&quot;
wrote Bentham, &quot;when there are no entails, no unalienable
endowments, no common lands, no right of redemptions, no tithes....&#148;
Such freedom in dealing with property, and especially property
in land, formed an essential part of the Benthamite conception
of individual liberty. To extend this freedom in one way or another
was the aim and effect of legislation such as the Prescriptions
Acts, the Inheritance Act, the Fines and Recoveries Act, the Real
Property Act, the general Enclosure Act of 1801 and its successors
(Dicey, A. V., op. Cit., P. 226), as well as the Copyhold Acts
from 1841 up to 1926. In France and much of the Continent the
Code Napoleon instituted middle-class forms of property, making
land a commerciable good and making mortgage a private civil contract.
(180)</P>

<P>The second step, overlapping the first, was the subordination
of land to the needs of a swiftly expanding urban population.
Although the soil cannot be physically mobilized, its produce
can, if transportation facilities and the law permit. &quot;Thus
the mobility of goods to some extent compenstites the lack of
interregional mobility of the factors; or (what is really the
sarne thing) trade mitigates the disadvantages of the unsuitable
geographical distribution of the productive facilities.&quot;
(Ohlin, B., Interregional and International Trade, 1935, P. 42).
Such a notion was entirely foreign to the traditional outlook.
&quot;Neither with the ancients, nor during the early Middle Ages
- this should be emphatically asserted - were the goods of every
day life regularly bought and sold.&quot; (Bilcher, K., Entstehung
der Volkswirtschaft, 1904. Cf. also Penrose, E. F., Population
Theories and Their Application, 1934, quotes Longfield, 1834,
for the first mention of the idea that movements of commodities
may be regarded as substitutes for movements of the factors of
production). Surpluses of grain were supposed provision the neighborhood,
especially the local town; corn markets up to the fifteenth century
had a strictly local organization. But the growth of towns induced
landlords to produce primarily for sale on the market and - in
England - the growth of the metropolis compelled authorities to
loosen the restrictions on the corn trade and allow it to become
regional, though never national. (180, 181)</P>

<P>Eventually agglomeration of the population in the industrial
towns of the second half of the eighteenth century changed the
situation completely - first on a national, then on a world scale.
To effect this change was the true meaning of free trade. The
mobilization of the produce of the land was extended from the
neighboring countryside to tropical and subtropical regions -
the industrial agricultural division of labor was applied to the
planet. As a result, peoples of distant zones were drawn into
the vortex of change the origins of which were obscure to them,
while the European nations became dependent for their everyday
activities upon a not yet ensured integration of the life of mankind.
With free trade the new and tremendous hazards of planetary interdependence
sprang into being. (181)</P>

<P>The scope of social defense against all-round dislocation was
as broad as the front of attack. Though common law and legislation
speeded up change at times, at others they slowed it down. However,common
law and statute law were not necessarily acting in the same direction
at any given time.(181)</P>

<P>In the advent of the labor market common law played mainly
a positive part - the commodity theory of labor was first stated
emphatically not by economists but by lawyers. On the issue of
labor combinations and the law of conspiracy, too, the common
law favored a free labor market, though this meant restricting
the freedom of association of organized workers. (181)</P>

<P>But, in respect to land, the common law shifted its role from
encouraging change to opposing it. During the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, more often than not common law insisted on the owner's
right to improve his land profitably even if this involved grave
dislocation in habitations and employment. On the Continent this
process of mobilization involved, as we know, the reception of
Roman law, while in England common law held its own and succeeded
in bridging the gap between restricted medieval property rights
and modem individual property without sacrificing the principle
of judge-made law vital to constitutional liberty. Since the eighteenth
century, on the other hand, common law in land acted as a conserver
of the past in the face of modernizing legislation. But eventually,
the Benthamites had their way, and, between 1830 and 1860, freedom
of contract was extended to the land. This powerful trend was
reversed only in the 1870&#146;s when legislation altered its
course radically. The &#147;collectivist&#148; period had begun.
(181, 182)</P>

<P>The inertia of the common law was deliberately enhanced by
statutes expressly passed in order to protect the habitations
and occupations of the rural classes against the effects of freedom
of contract. A comprehensive effort was launched to ensure some
degree of health and salubrity in the housing of the poor, providing
them with allotments, giving them a chance to escape from the
slums and to breathe the fresh air of nature, the &#147;gentleman&#146;s
park.&#148; Wretched Irish tenants and London slum dwellers were
rescued from the grip of the laws of the market by legislative
acts designed to protect their habitations against teh juggernaut,
improvement. On the Continent it was mainly statute law and administrative
action that saved the tenant, the peasant, the agricultural laborer
from the most violent effects of urbanization. Prussian conservatives
such as Rodbertus, whose Junker socialism influenced Marx, were
blood brothers to the Tory-Democrats of England. (182)</P>

<P>Frequently, the problem of protection arose in regard to the
agricultural populations of whole countries and continents. International
free trade, if unchecked, must necessarily eliminate ever-larger
compact bodies of agricultural producers. This inevitable process
of destruction was very much aggravated by the inherent discontinuity
in the development of modern means of transportation, which are
too expensive to be extended into new regions of the planet unless
the prize to be gained is high. Once the great investments involved
in the building of steamships and railroads came to fruition,
whole continents were opened up and an avalanche of grain descended
upon unhappy Europe. This was contrary to classical prognostication.
Ricardo had erected it into an axiom that the most fertile land
was settled first. This was turned to scorn in a spectacular manner
when the railways found more fertile land in the antipodes. Central
Europe, facing utter destruction of its rural society, was forced
to protect its peasantry by introducing corn laws. (182)</P>

<P>But if the organized states of Europe could protect themselves
against the backwash of international free trade, the politically
unorganized colonial peoples could not. The revolt against imperialism
was mainly an attempt on the part of exotic peoples to achieve
the political status necessary to shelter themselves from the
social dislocations caused by European trade policies. The protection
that the white man could easily secure for himself, through the
sovereign status of his communities was out of reach of the colored
man as long as he lacked the prerequsite, political government.
(182, 183)</P>

<P>The trading classes sponsored the demand for mobilization of
the land. Cobden set the landlords of England aghast with his
discovery that farming was &#147;business&#148; and that those
who were broke must clear out. The working classes were won over
to free trade as soon as it became apparent that it made food
cheaper. Trade unions became the bastions of anti-agrarianism
and revolutionary socialism branded the peasantry of the world
an indiscriminate mass of reactionaries. International division
of labor was doubtless a progressive creed; and its opponents
were often recruited from amongst those whose judgement was vitated
by vested interests or lack of natural intelligence. The few independent
and disinterested minds who discovered the fallacies of unrestricted
free trade were too few to make any impression. (183)</P>

<P>And yet their consequences were no less real for not being
consciously recognized. In effect, the great influence wielded
by landed interests in Western Europe and the survival of feudal
forms of life in Central and Eastern Europe during the nineteenth
century are readily explained by the vital protective function
of these forces in retarding the mobilization of the land. The
question was often raised: what enabled the feudal aristocracy
of the Continent to maintain their sway in the middle-class state
once they had shed the military, judicial, and administrative
functions to which they owed their ascendency? The theory of &#147;survivals&#148;
was sometimes adduced as an explanation, according to which functionless
insitutions or traits may continue to exist by virtue of inertia.
Yet it would be truer to say that no institution survives its
function - when it appears to do so, it is because it serves in
some other function, or functions, which need not include the
original one. Thus feudalism and landed conservatism retained
their strength as long as they served a purpose that happened
to be that of restricting the disastrous effects of the mobilization
of land. By this time it had been forgotten by free traders that
land formed part of the territory of the country, and that the
territorial character of sovereignity was not merely a result
of sentimental associations, but of massive facts, including econonuc
ones. &quot;In contrast to the nomadic peoples, the cultivator
commits himself to improvements fixed in a particular place. Without
such improvements human life must remain elementary, and little
removed from that of animals. And how large a role have these
fixtures played in human history! It is they, the cleared and
cultivated lands, the houses, and the other buildings, the means
of communication, the multifarious plant necessary for production,
including industry and mining, all the permanent and immovable
improvements that tie a human community to the locality where
it is. They cannot be improvised, but must be built up gradually
by generations of patient effort, and the community cannot afford
to sacrifice them and start afresh elsewhere. Hence that territorial
character of sovereignty, which permeates our political conceptions.&quot;
(Hawtrey, R. G., The Economic Problem, 1933). For a century these
obvious truths were ridiculed. (183, 184)</P>

<P>The economic argument could be easily expanded so as to include
the conditions of safety and security attached to the integrity
of the soil and its resources - such as the vigor and stamina
of the population, the abundance of food supplies, the amount
and character of defense materials, even the climate of the country
which might suffer from the denudation of forests, from erosions
and dust bowls, all of which, ultimately, depend upon the factor
land, yet none of which respond to the supply-and-demand mechanism
of the market. Given a system entirely dependent upon market functions
for the safeguarding of its existential needs, confidence will
naturally turn to such forces outside the market system which
are capable of ensuring common interests jeopardized by that system.
Such a view is in keeping with our appreciation of the true sources
of class influence: instead of trying to explain developments
that run counter to the general trend of the time by the (unexplained)
influence of reactionary classes, we prefer to explain the influence
of such classes by the fact that they, even though incidentally,
stand for developments only seemingly contrary to the general
interest of the community. That their own interests are often
all too well served by such a policy offers only another illustration
of the truth that classes manage to profit disproportionately
from these services that they may render to the commonalty. (184)</P>

<P>An instance was offered by Speenhamland. The squire who ruled
the village struck upon a way of slowing down the rise in rural
wages and the threatening dislocation of the traditional structure
of village life. In the long run, the method chosen was bound
to have the most nefarious results. Yet the squires would not
have been able to maintain their practices, unless by doing so
they had assisted the country as a whole to meet the ground swell
of the Industrial Revolution. (184, 185)</P>

<P>On the continent of Europe, again, agrarian protectionism was
a necessity. But the most active intellectual forces of the age
were engaged in an adventure which happened to shift their angle
of vision so as to hide from them the true significance of the
agrarian plight. Under the circumstances, a group able to represent
the endangered rural interests could gain an influence out of
proportion to their numbers. The protectionist countermovement
actually succeeded in stabilizing the European countryside and
in weakening that drift towards the towns which was the scourge
of the time. Reaction was the beneficiary of a socially useful
function which it happened to perform. The identical function
which allowed reactionary classes in Europe to make play with
traditional sentiments in their fight for agrarian tariffs was
responsible in America about a half century later for the success
of the TVA and other progressive social techniques. The same needs
of society which benefited democracy in the New World strengthened
their influence of the aristocracy in the Old. (185)</P>

<P>Opposition to mobilization of the land was the sociological
background of that struggle between liberalism and reaction that
made up the political history of Continental Europe in the nineteenth
century. In this struggle, the military and the higher clergy
were allies of the landed classes, who had almost completely lost
their more immediate functions in society. These classes were
now available for any reactionary solution of the impasse to which
market economy and its corollary, constitutional government, threatened
to lead since they were not bound by tradition and ideology to
public liberties and parliamentary rule. (185)</P>

<P>Briefly, economic liberalism was wedded to the liberal state,
while landed interests were not - this was the source of their
permanent political significance on the Continent, which produced
the crosscurrents of Prussian politics under Bismarck, fed clerical
and militarist revanche in France, ensured court influence for
the feudal aristocracy in the Hapsburg empire, made Church and
Army the guardians of crumbling thrones. Since the connection
outlasted the critical two generations once laid down by John
Maynard Keynes as the practical alternative to eternity, land
and landed property were now credited with a congenital bias for
reaction. Eighteenth century England with its Tory free traders
and agrarian pioneers was as forgotten as the Tudor engrossers
and their revolutionary methods of making money from the land;
the Physiocratic landlord of France and Germany with their enthusiasm
for free trade were obliterated in the public mind by the modern
prejudice of the everlasting backwardness of the rural scene.
Herbert Spencer, with whom one generation sufficed as a sample
of eternity, simply identified militarism with reaction. The social
and technological adaptability recently shown by the Nipponese,
the Russian, or the Nazi army would have been inconceivable to
him. (185, 186)</P>

<P>Such thoughts were narrowly time-bound. The stupendous industrial
achievements of market economy had been bought at the price of
great harm to the substance of society. The feudal classes found
therein an occasion to retrieve some of their lost prestige by
turning advocates of the virtues of the land and its cultivators.
In literary romanticism Nature had made its alliance with the
Past; in the agrarian movement of the nineteenth century feudalism
was trying not unsuccessfully to recover its past by presenting
itself as the guardian of man&#146;s natural habitat, the soil.
If the danger had not been genuine, the stratagem could not have
worked (186)</P>

<P>But Army and Church gained prestige also by being available
for the &quot;defense of law and order,&quot; which now became
highly vulnerable, while the ruling middle class was not fitted
to ensure this requirement of the new economy. The market system
was more allergic to rioting than any other economic system we
know. Tudor governments relied on riots to call attention to local
complaints; a few ringleaders might be hanged, otherwise no harm
was done. The rise of the financial Market meant a complete break
with such an attitude; after 1797 rioting ceases to be a popular
feature of London life, its place is gradually taken by meetings
at which, at least in principle, the hands are counted which otherwise
would be raining blows. (Trevelyan, G. M., History of England,
1926, p. 533. &quot;England under Walpole, was still an aristocracy,
tempered by rioting.&quot; Hannah More's &quot;repository&quot;
song, &quot;The Riot&quot; was written &quot;in ninety-five, a
year of scarcity and alarm&quot; - it was the year of Speenhamland.
Cf. The Repository Tracts, Vol. I, New York, 1835. Also The Library,
1940, fourth series, Vol. XX, P. 295, on &quot;Cheap Repository
Tracts (1795-98)&#148;). The Prussian king who proclaimed that
to keep the peace was the subject's first and foremost duty, became
famous for this paradox; yet very soon it was a commonplace. In
the nineteenth century breaches of the peace, if committed by
armed crowds, were deemed an incipient rebellion and an acute
danger to the state; stocks collapsed and there was no bottom
in prices. A shooting affray in the streets of the metropolis
might destroy a substantial part of the nominal national capital.
And yet the middle classes were unsoldierly; popular democracy
prided itself on making the masses vocal; and, on the Continent,
the bourgeoisie still clung to the recollections of its revolutionary
youth when it had itself faced a tyrannic aristocracy on the barricades.
Eventually, the peasantry, least contaminated by the liberal virus,
were reckoned the only stratum that would stand in their persons
&quot;for law and order.&quot; One of the functions of reaction
was understood to be to keep the working classes in their place,
so that markets should not be thrown into panic. Though this service
was only very infrequently required, the availability of the peasantry
as the defenders of property-rights was an asset to the agrarian
camp.(186, 187)</P>

<P>The history of the 1920's would be otherwise inexplicable.
When, in Central Europe, the social structure broke down under
the strain of war and defeat, the working class alone was available
for the task of keeping things going. Everywhere power was thrust
upon the trade unions and Social Democratic parties: Austria,
Hungary, even Germany, were declared republics although no active
republican party had ever been known to exist in any of these
countries before. But hardly had the acute danger of dissolution
passed and the services of the trade unions become superfluous
than the middle classes tried to exclude the working classes from
all influence on public life. This is known as the counterrevolutionary
phase of the postwar period. Actually, there was never any serious
danger of a Communist regime since the workers were organized
in parties and unions actively hostile to the Communists. (Hungary
had a Bolshevik episode literally forced upon the country when
defense against French invasion left no alternative to the nation.)
The peril was not Bolshevism, but disregard of the rules of market
economy on the part of trade unions and working-class parties,
in an emergency. For under a market economy otherwise harmless
interruptions of public order and trading habits might constitute
a lethal threat (Hayes, C., A Generation of Materialism, 1870-1890,
remarks that &quot;most of the individual states, at least in
Western and Central Europe, now possessed a seemingly superlative
internal stability) since they could cause the breakdown of the
economic regime upon which society depended for its daily bread.
This explained the remarkable shift in some countries from a supposedly
imminent dictatorship of the industrial workers to the actual
dictatorship of the peasantry. Right through the twenties the
peasantry determined economic policy in a number of states in
which they normally played but a modest role. They now happened
to be the only class available to maintain law and order in the
modern high-strung sense of the term. (187, 188)</P>

<P>The fierce agrarianism of postwar Europe was a side light on
the preferential treatment accorded to the peasant class for political
reasons. From the Lappo movement in Finland to the Austrian Heimwehr
the peasants proved the champions of market economy; this made
them politically indispensable. The scarcity of food in the first
postwar years to which their ascendancy was sometimes credited
had little to do with this. Austria, for instance, in order to
benefit the peasants financially, had to lower her food standards
by maintaining duties for grain, though she was heavily dependent
upon imports for her food requirements. But the peasant interest
had to be safeguarded at all cost even though agrarian protectionism
might mean misery to the town dwellers and an unreasonably high
cost of production to the exporting industries. The formerly uninfluential
class of peasants gained in this manner an ascendancy quite disproportionate
to their economic importance. Fear of Bolshevism was the force
which made their political position impregnable. And yet that
fear, as we saw, was not fear of a working-class dictatorship
- nothing faintly similar was on the horizon - but rather the
dread of a paralysis of market economy, unless all forces were
eliminated from the political scene that, under duress, might
set aside the rules of the market game. As long as the peasants
were the only class able to eliminate these forces, their prestige
stood high and they could hold the urban middle class in ransom.
As soon as the consolidation of the power of the state - and even
before that - the forming of the urban lower middle class into
storm troops by the fascists, freed the bourgeoisie from dependence
upon the peasantry, the latter's prestige was quickly deflated.
Once the &quot;internal enemy&quot; in town and factory had been
neutralized or subdued, the peasantry was relegated to its former
modest position in industrial society. (188)</P>

<P>The big landowners' influence did not share in this eclipse.
A more constant factor worked in their favor - the increasing
military importance of agricultural self-sufficiency. The Great
War had brought the basic strategic facts home to the public,
and thoughtless reliance on the world market gave way to a panicky
hoarding of food producing capacity. The &quot;reagrarianization&quot;
of Central Europe started by the Bolshevik scare was completed
in the sign of autarchy. Besides the argument of the &quot;internal
enemy&quot; there was now the argument of the &quot;external enemy.&quot;
Liberal economists, as usual, saw merely a romantic aberration
induced by unsound economic doctrines, where in reality towering
political events were awakening even the simplest minds to the
irrelevance of economic considerations in the face of the approaching
dissolution of the international system. Geneva continued its
futile attempts to convince the peoples that they were hoarding
against imaginary perils, and that if only all acted in unison
free trade could be restored and would benefit all. In the curiously
credulous atmosphere of the time many took for granted that the
solution of the economic problem (whatever that may mean) would
not only assuage the threat of war but actually avert that threat
forever. A hundred years' peace had created an insurmountable
wall of illusions which hid the facts. The writers of that period
excelled in lack of realism. The nation-state was deemed a parochial
prejudice by A. J. Toynbee, sovereignty a ridiculous illusion
by Ludwig von Mises, war a mistaken calculation in business by
Norman Angell. Awareness of the essential nature of the problems
of politics sank to an unprecedented low point. (188, 189)</P>

<P>Free trade which, in 1846, had been fought and won on the Corn
Laws, was eighty years later fought over again and this time lost
on the same issue. The problem of autarchy haunted market economy
from the start. Accordingly, economic liberals exercised the specter
of war and naively based their case on the assumption of an indestructible
market economy. It went unnoticed that their arguments merely
showed how great was the peril of a people which relied for its
safety on an institution as frail as the self-regulating market.
The autarchy movement of the twenties was essentially prophetic:
it pointed to the need for adjustment to the vanishing of an order.
The Great War had shown up the danger and men acted accordingly;
but since they acted ten years later, the connection between cause
and effect was discounted as unreasonable. &quot;Why protect oneself
against passed dangers?&quot; was the comment of many contemporaries.
This faulty logic befogged not only an understanding of autarchy
but, even more important, that of fascism. Actually, both were
explained by the fact that once the cornmon mind has received
the impress of a danger, fear remains latent, as long as its causes
are not removed. (189)</P>

<P>We claimed that the nations of Europe never overcame the shock
of the war experience which unexpectedly confronted them with
the perils of interdependence. In vain was trade resumed, in vain
did swarms of international conferences display the idylls of
peace, and dozens of governments declare for the principle of
freedom of trade - no people could forget that unless they owned
their food and raw material sources themselves or were certain
of military access to them, neither sound currency nor unassailable
credit would rescue them from helplessness. Nothing could be more
logical than the consistency with which this fundamental consideration
shaped the policy of communities. The source of the peril was
not removed. Why then expect fear to subside? (189, 190)</P>

<P>A similar fallacy tricked those critics of fascism - they formed
the great majority - who described fascism as a freak devoid of
all political ratio. Mussolini, it was said, claimed to have averted
Bolshevism in Italy, while statistics proved that for more than
a year before the March on Rome the strike wave had subsided.
Armed workers, it was conceded, occupied the factories in 1921.
But was that a reason for disarming them in 1923, when they had
long climbed down again from the walls where they had mounted
guard? Hitler claimed he had saved Germany from Bolshevism. But
could it not be shown that the flood of unemployment which preceded
his chancellorship had ebbed away before his rise to power? To
claim that he averted that which no longer existed when he came,
as was argued, was contrary to the law of cause and effect, which
must also hold in politics. (190)</P>

<P>Actually, in Germany as in Italy, the story of the immediate
postwar period proved that Bolshevism had not the slightest chance
of success. But it also showed conclusively that in an emergency
the working class, its trade unions and parties, might disregard
the rules of the market which established freedom of contract
and the sanctity of private property as absolutes - a possibility
which must have the most deleterious effects on society, discouraging
investments, preventing the accumulation of capital, keeping wages
on an unremunerative level, endangering the currency, undermining
foreign credit, weakening confidence and paralyzing enterprise.
Not the illusionary danger of a communist revolution, but the
undeniable fact that the working classes were in the position
to force possibly ruinous interventions, was the source of the
latent fear which, at a crucial juncture, burst forth in the fascist

<P>The dangers to man and nature cannot be neatly separated. The
reactions of the working class and the peasantry to market economy
both led to protectionism, the former mainly in the form of social
legislation and factory laws, the latter in agrarian tariffs and
land laws. Yet there was this important difference: in an emergency,
the farmers and peasants of Europe defended the market system,
which the working class policies endangered. While the crisis
of the inherently unstable system was brought on by both wings
of the Protectionist movement, the social strata connected with
the land were inclined to compromise with the market system, while
the broad class of labor did not shrink from breaking its rules
and challenging it outright. (190, 191) &nbsp;
