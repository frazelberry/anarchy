  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>TO SEPARATE LABOR from other activities of life and to subject
  it to the laws of the market was to annihilate all organic forms
  of existence and to replace them by a different type of organization,
  an atomistic and individualisticone. (163)</P>
  <P>Such a scheme of destruction was best served by the application
  of the principle of freedom of contract. In practice this meant
  that the noncontractual organizations of kinship, neighborhood,
  profession, and creed were to be liquidated since they claimed
  the allegiance of the individual and thus restrained his freedom.
  To represent this principle as one of noninterference, as economic
  liberals were wont to do, was merely the expression of an ingrained
  prejudice in favor of a definite kind of interference, namely,
  such as would destroy noncontractual relations between individuals
  and prevent their spontaneous re-formation. (163)</P>
  <P>This effect of the establishment of a labor market is conspicuously
  apparent in colonial regions today. The natives are to be forced
  to make a living by selling their labor. To this end their traditional
  institutions must be destroyed, and prevented from re-forming,
  since, as a rule, the individual in primitive society is not
  threatened by starvation unless the community as a whole is in
  a like predicament. Under the kraal-land system of the Kaffirs,
  for instance, &quot;destitution is impossible: whosoever needs
  assistance receives it unquestioningly.&quot; (Mair, L. P., An
  African People in the Twentieth Century, 1934) &#147;No Kwakiutl
  ever ran the least risk of going hungry.&quot; (Loeb, E. M.,
  The Distribution and Function of Money in Early Society. In Essays
  in Anthropology, 1936) &#147;There is no starvation in societies
  living on the subsistence margin.&quot; (Herskovits, M. J., The
  Economic Life of Primitive Peoples, 1940) The principle of freedom
  from want was equally acknowledged in the Indian village community
  and,.we might add, under almost every and any type of social
  organization up to about the beginning of sixteenth century Europe,
  when the modern ideas on the poor put forth by the humanist Vives
  were argued before the Sorbonne. It is the absence of the threat
  of individual starvation which makes primitive society, in a
  sense, more human than market economy, and at the same time less
  economic. Ironically, the white man's initial contribution to
  the black man's world mainly consisted in introducing him to
  the uses of the scourge of hunger. Thus the colonists may decide
  to cut the readfruit trees down in order to create an artificial
  food scarcity or may impose a hut tax on the native to force
  him to barter away his labor. In either case the effect is similar
  to that of Tudor enclosures with their wake of vagrant hordes.
  A League of Nations report mentioned with due horror the recent
  appearance of that ominous figure of the sixteenth century European
  scene, the &quot;masterless man,&quot; in the African bush. (Thurnwald,
  R. C., op. cit.) During the late Middle Ages he had been found
  only in the &quot;interstices&quot; of society. (Brinkmann, C.,
  &quot;Das soziale System des Kapitalismus,&quot; Grundriss de
  Social-okonomik, 1924) Yet he was the forerunner of the nomadic
  laborer of the nineteenth century. (Toynbee, A., Lectures on
  the Industrial Revolution, 1887, p. 98) (163, 164)</P>
  <P>Now, what the white man may still occasionally practice in
  remote regions today, namely, the smashing up of social structures
  in order to extract the element of labor from them, was done
  in the eighteenth century to white populations by white men for
  similar purposes. Hobbes' grotesque vision of the State -a human
  Leviathan whose vast body was made up of an infinite number of
  human bodies - was dwarfed by the Ricardian construct of the
  labor market: a flow of human lives the supply of which was regulated
  by the amount of food put at their disposal. Although it was
  acknowledged that there existed a customary standard below which
  no laborer's wages could sink, this limitation also was thought
  to become effective only if the laborer was reduced to the choice
  of being left without food or of offering his labor in the market
  for the price it would fetch. This explains, incidentally, an
  otherwise inexplicable omission of the classical economists,
  namely, why only the penalty of starvation, not also the allurement
  of high wages, was deemed capable of creating a functioning labor
  market. Here also colonial experience has confirmed theirs. For
  the higher the wages the smaller the inducement to exertion on
  the part of the native, who unlike the white man was not compelled
  by his cultural standards to make as much money as he possibly
  could. The analogy wp all the more striking as the early laborer,
  too, abhorred the factory, where he felt degraded and tortured,
  like the native who often resigned himself to work in our fashion
  only when threatened with corporal punishment, if not physical
  mutilation. The Lyons manufacturers of the eighteenth century
  urged low Nyages primarily for social reasons. (Heckscher, E.
  F., op. cit., Vol. II, p. 166) Only an overworked and downtrodden
  laborer, they argued, would forgo to associate with his comrades
  and escape the condition of personal servitude under which he
  could be made to do whatever his master required from him. Legal
  compulsion and parish serfdom as in England, the rigors of an
  absolutist labor police as on the Continent, indented labor as
  in the early Americas were the prerequisites of the &quot;willing
  worker.&quot; But the final stage was reached with the application
  of &quot;nature's penalty,&quot; hunger. In order to release
  it, it was necessary to liquidate organic society, which refused
  to.permit the individual to starve.(164, 165)</P>
  <P>The protection of society, in the first instance, falls to
  the rulers, who can directly enforce their will. However, it
  is all too easily assumed by economic liberals that economic
  rulers tend to be beneficial, while political rulers do not.
  Adam Smith did not seem to think so when he urged that direct
  British rule should replace administration through a chartered
  company in India. Political rulers, he argued, would have parallel
  interests with the ruled whose wealth would swell their revenue,
  while the merchant's interests were naturally antagonistic to
  those of his customers. (165)</P>
  <P>By interest.and inclination it fell to the landlords of England
  to protect the lives of the common people from the onrush of
  the Industrial Revolution. Speenhamland was a moat erected in
  defense of the traditional rural organization, when the turmoil
  of change was sweeping the countryside, and, incidentally, making
  agriculture a precarious industry. In their natural reluctance
  to bow to the needs of the manufacturing towns, the squires were
  the first to make a stand in what proved to be a century's losing
  fight. Yet their resistance was not in vain; it averted ruin
  for several generations and allowed time for almost complete
  readjustment. Over a critical span of forty years it retarded
  economic progress, and when, in 1834, the Reform Parliament abolished
  Speenhamland, the landlords shifted their resistance to the factory
  laws. The Church and the manor were now rousing the people against
  the mill owner whose predominance would make the cry for cheap
  food irresistible, and thus, indirectly, threaten to sap rents
  and tithes. Oastler, for one, was &quot;a Churchman, a Tory,
  and a Protectionist&quot; (Dicey, A. V., op. cit., p. 226); moreover,
  he was also a Humanitarian. So were also, with, varying mixtures
  of these ingredients of Tory socialism, the other great fighters
  in the factory movement: Sadler, Southey and Lord Shaftesbury.
  But the premonition of threatening pecuniary losses which prompted
  the bulk of their followers proved only too well grounded: Manchester
  exporters were soon clamoring for lower wages involving cheaper
  grain- the repeal of Speenhamland and the growth of the factories
  actually prepared the way for the success of the Amti-Com Law
  agitation, in 1846. Yet, for adventitious reasons, the ruin of
  agriculture was postponed in England for a whole generation.
  Meanwhile Disraeli grounded Tory socialism on a protest against
  the Poor Law Reform Act, and the conservative landlords of England
  forced radically new techniques of life upon an industrial society.
  The Ten Hours Bill of 1847, which Karl Marx hailed as the first
  victory of socialism, was the work of enlightened reactionaries.(166)</P>
  <P>The laboring people themselves were hardly a factor in this
  great movement the effect of which was, figuratively speaking,
  to allow them to survive the Middle Passage. They had almost
  as little to say in the determination of their own fate as the
  black cargo of Hawkins' ships. Yet it was precisely this lack
  of active participation on the part of the British working class
  in deciding its own fate that determined the course of English
  social history and made it, for better or for worse, so different
  from that of the Continent. (166)</P>
  <P>There is a peculiar touch about the undirected excitements,
  the rumblings and blunders of a nascent class, the true nature
  of which history has long since revealed. Politically, the British
  working class was defined by the Parliamentary Reform Act of
  1832, which refused them the vote; economically, by the Poor
  Law Reform Act of 1834, which excluded them from relief and distinguished
  them from the pauper. For some time to come the industrial working-class-to-be
  was uncertain whether its salvation did not lie after all in
  a return to rural existence and conditions of handicraft. In
  the two decades following Speenhamland its endeavors were focused
  on the stopping of the free use of machinery either by the enforcement
  of the apprenticeship clauses of the Statute of Artificers or
  by direct action as in Luddism. This backward-looking attitude
  lingered on as an undercurrent all through the Owenite movement
  till the end of the forties, when the Ten Hours Bill, the eclipse
  of Chartism, and the beginning of the Golden Age of capitalism
  obliterated the vision of the past. Up to that time the British
  working class in statu nascendi was a riddle unto itself; and
  only if one follows with understanding its half-unconscious stirrings
  is it possible to gauge the immensity of the loss England suffered
  through the exclusion of the working class from an equal share
  in national life. When Owenism and Chartism had burned themselves
  out, England had become poorer by that substance out of which
  the Anglo-Saxon ideal of a free society could have been built
  up for centuries to come. (166, 167)</P>
  <P>Even if the Owenite movement had resulted only in inconsiderable
  local activities, it would have formed a monument to the creative
  imagination of the race and even if Chartism had never penetrated
  beyond the confines of that nucleus which conceived of the idea
  of a national holiday to gain the rights of the people, it would
  have shown that some of the people were still able to dream their
  own dreams, and were taking the measure of a society which had
  forgotten the shape of man. Yet neither the one nor the other
  was the case. Owenism was not the inspiration of a minute sect,
  nor was Chartism restricted to a political elite; both movements
  comprised hundreds of thousands of craftsmen and artisans, laborers
  and working people, and with their vast following ranked among
  the biggest social movements in modern history. And yet different
  as they were and similar only in the measure of their failure,
  they served to prove how inevitable from the first the necessity
  was of protecting man against the market. (167)</P>
  <P>The Owenite Movement originally was neither political nor
  working class. It represented the cravings of the common people,
  smitten by the coming of the factory, to discover a form of existence
  which would make man master of the machine. Essentially, it aimed
  at what would appear to us as a by-passing of capitalism. Such
  a formula would, of course be bound to be somewhat misleading
  , since the organizing role of capital and the nature of a self-regulating
  market were still unknown. Yet it expresses perhaps best the
  spirit of Owen, who emphatically was not an enemy of the machine.
  In spite of the machine, he believed, man should remain his own
  employer; the principle of co-operation or &quot;union&quot;
  would solve the problem of the machine without sacrificing either
  individual freedom or social solidarity, either man's dignity
  or his sympathy with his fellows.(167)</P>
  <P>The strength of Owenism was that its inspiration was eminently
  practical, and yet its methods were based on an appreciation
  of man as a whole. Although the problems were intrinsically those
  of every day life such as the quality of food, housing, and education,
  the level of wages, the avoidance of unemployment, support in
  sickness find the like, the issues involved were as broad as
  the moral forces they appealed to. The conviction that, if only
  the right method was found, man's existence could be restored
  enabled the roots of the movement to penetrate into that deeper
  layer where personality itself is formed. There rarely was a
  less intellectualized social movement of a similar scope; the
  convictions of those engaged in it imbued even their seemingly
  most trivial activities with meaning, so that no set creed was
  needed. Indeed their faith was prophetic, since they insisted
  on methods of reconstruction which transcended market economy.
  (167, 168)</P>
  <P>Owenism was a religion of industry the bearer of which was
  the working class.( Cole, G. D. H., Robert Owen, <!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->1925,
  a work on which we have heavily drawn) Its wealth of forms and
  initiatives was unrivaled. Practically, it was the beginning
  of the modem trade union movement. Cooperative societies were
  founded, mainly engaged in retail to their members. These were
  not, of course, regular consumers' co-operatives, but rather
  stores backed by enthusiasts determined to devote the profits
  of the venture to the furtherance of Owenite plans, preferably
  to the establishment of Villages of Co-operation. &quot;Their
  activities were quite as much educational and propagandist as
  commercial; their aim was the creation of the New Society by
  their associated effort.&quot; The &quot;Union Shops&quot; erected
  by members of trade unions were more in the nature of producers'
  co-operatives, unemployed artisans could find work there, or,
  in case of strikes, earn some money in lieu of strike pay. In
  the Owenite &quot;Labour Exchange&quot; the idea of the co-operative
  store was developed into an institution sui generis. At the heart
  of the Exchange or Bazaar there was reliance on the complementary
  nature of the crafts; by providing for one another's needs, artisans
  would emancipate themselves, it was thought, from the ups and
  downs of the market; this was, later, accompanied by the use
  of labor notes which had a considerable circulation. Such a device
  might seem fantastic today; but in Owen's time the character
  not only of wage labor, but also of bank notes, was still unexplored.
  Socialism was not essentially different from those projects and
  inventions with which the Benthamite movement was teeming. Not
  only the rebellious opposition, but also the respectable middle
  class was still in an experimentative mood. Jeremy Bentham himself
  invested in Owen's futuristic education scheme in New Lanark,
  and earned a dividend. The Owenite Societies proper were associations
  or clubs designed to support plans of Villages of Co-operation
  such as we described in connection with the relief of the poor;
  this was the origin of the argricultural producers' co-operative,
  an idea which had a long and distinguished career. The first
  national producers' organization with syndicalist aims was the
  Operative Builders' Union, which attempted to regulate the building
  trade directly by creating &quot;buildings upon the most extensive
  scale,&quot; introducing a currency of its own, and exhibiting
  the means of realizing &quot;the great association for the emancipation
  of the reductive classes.&quot; The industrial producers' co-operatives
  of the nineteenth century date from this venture. It was from
  the Builders' Union or Guild and its Parliament, that the even
  more ambitious consolidated Trades Union sprang, which for a
  short time comprised almost a million workers and artisans in
  its loose federation of trade unions and co-operative societies.
  Its idea was industrial revolt by peaceful means, which will
  appear as no contradiction once we remember that in the messianistic
  dawn of their movement the mere consciousness of their mission
  was supposed to make the aspirations of the working people irresistible.
  The martyrs of Tolpuddle belonged to a rural branch of this organization.
  Propaganda for factory legislation was carried on by Regeneration
  Societies; while later on ethical societies were founded the
  forerunners of the secularist movement. The idea of nonviolent
  resistance was fully developed in their midst. Like Saint-Simonianism
  in France, Owenism in England showed all the characteristics
  of spiritual inspiration; but while Saint-Simon worked for a
  renaissance of Christianity, Owen was the first opponent of Christianity
  amongst modern working-class leaders. The consumers' co-operatives
  of Great Britain which found imitators all over the world were,
  of course, the most eminently practical offshoot of Owenism.
  That its impetus was lost - or, rather, was maintained only in
  the peripheric sphere of the consumers' movement - was the greatest
  single defeat of spiritual forces in the history of industrial
  England. Yet a people, which, after the moral debasement of the
  Speenhamland period, still possessed the resilience required
  for a creative effort so imaginative and sustained, must have
  disposed of almost boundless intellectual and emotional vigor.
  (168, 169)</P>
  <P>To Owenism with its claim to man as a whole there still clung
  something of that medieval inheritance of corporative life which
  found expression in the Builders' Guild and in the rural scene
  of its social ideal, the Villages of Co-operation. Although it
  was the fount of modern socialism, its proposals were not based
  on the property issue, which is the legal aspect only of capitalism.
  In hitting on the new phenomenon of industry, as Saint-Simon
  had done, it recognized the challenge of the machine. But the
  characteristic trait in Owenism was that it insisted on the social
  approach: it refused to accept the division of society into an
  economic and political sphere, and, in effect, rejected political
  action on that account. The acceptance of a separate economic
  sphere would have implied the recognition of the principle of
  gain and profit as the organizing force in society. This Owen
  refused to do. His genius recognized that the incorporation of
  the machine was possible only in a new society. The industrial
  aspect of things was to him in no way restricted to the economic
  (this would have implied a marketing view of society which he
  rejected). New Lanark had taught him that in a worker's life
  wages was only one among many factors such as natural and home
  surroundings, quality and prices of commodities, stability of
  employment, and security of tenure. (The factories of New Lanark
  like some other firms before them kept their employees on the
  payroll even when there was no work for them to do.) But much
  more than that was comprised in the adjustment. The education
  of children and adults, provision for entertainment, dance, and
  music, and the general assumption of high moral and personal
  standards of old and young created the atmosphere in which a
  new status was attained by the industrial population as a whole.
  Thousands of persons from all over Europe (and even America)
  visited New Lanark as if it were a reservation of the future
  in which had been accomplished the impossible feat of running
  a successful factory business with a human population. Yet Owen's
  firm paid considerably lower wages than those current in some
  neighboring towns. The profits of New Lanark sprang mainly from
  the high productivity of labor on shorter hours, due to excellent
  organization and rested men, advantages which outweighed the
  increase in real wages involved in the generous provisions for
  a decent life. But the latter alone explain the sentiments of
  all but adulation with which his workers clung to Owen. Out of
  experiences such as these he extracted the social, that is, wider-
  than- economic approach to the problem of industry. (169, 170)</P>
  <P>It was another tribute to his insight that in spite of this
  comprehensive outlook he grasped the incisive nature of the concrete
  physical facts dominating the laborer's existence. His religious
  sense revolted against the practical transcendentalism of a Hannah
  More and her Cheap Repository Tracts. One of them commended the
  example of a Lancashire colliery girl. She was taken down the
  pit, at the age of nine, to act as drawer with her brother, who
  was two years younger.&quot; (More, H., The Lancashire Colliery
  Girl, May,1795; cf. Hammond, J. L.and B., The Town Labourer,
  1917, P. 230) She cheerfully followed him [her father] down into
  the coal-pit, burying herself in the bowels of the earth, and
  there at a tender age, without excusing herself on account of
  her sex, she joined in the same work with the miners, a race
  of men rough indeed, but highly useful to the community.&quot;
  The father was killed by an accident down the pit in the sight
  of his children. She then applied for employment as a servant,
  but there was a prejudice against her because she had been a
  Collier, and her application failed. Fortunately, by that comforting
  dispensation by which afflictions are turned into blessings,
  her bearing and patience attracted notice, inquiries were made
  at the colliery, and she received such a glowing character that
  she was taken into employment. &quot;This story,&quot; the tract
  concluded, &quot;may teach the poor that they can seldom be in
  any condition of life so low as to prevent their rising to some
  degree of independence if they choose to exert themselves, and
  there can be no situation whatever so mean as to forbid the practice
  of many noble virtues.&quot; The sisters More preferred to work
  among starving laborers, but refused so much as to be interested
  in their physical sufferings. They were inclined to solve the
  physical problem of industrialism by simply conferring status
  and function on the workers out of the plenitude of their magnanimity.
  Hannah More insisted that her heroine's father was a highly useful
  member of the community; the rank of his daughter was recognized
  by the acknowledgments of her employers. Hannah More believed
  that no more was needed for a functioning society. (Cf. Drucker,
  P. F., The End of Economic Man, 1939, p. 93, on the English Evangelicals;
  and The Future of Industrial Man, 1942, pp 21 and 194 on status
  and function.) Owen turned away from a Christianity which renounced
  the task of mastering the world of man, and which preferred to
  extol the imaginary status and function of Hannah More's wretched
  heroine, instead of facing the awful revelation that transcended
  the New Testament, of man's condition in a complex society. Nobody
  can doubt the sincerity which inspired Hannah More's conviction
  that the more readily the poor acquiesced in their condition
  of degradation, the more easily they would turn to the heavenly
  solaces on which alone she relied both for their salvation and
  for the smooth functioning of a market society in which she firmly
  believed. But these empty husks of Christianity on which the
  inner life of the most generous of the upper classes was vegetating
  contrasted but poorly with the creative faith of that religion
  of industry in the spirit of which the common people of England
  were endeavoring to redeem society. However, capitalism had still
  a future in store. (171, 172)</P>
  <P>The Chartist Movement appealed to a set of impulses so different
  that its emergence after the practical failure of Owenism and
  its premature initiatives might have been almost predicted. It
  was a purely political effort which made a bid for influence
  on government through constitutional channels; its attempt to
  put pressure on the government was on the traditional lines of
  the Reform Movement which had secured the vote to the middle
  classes. The Six Points of the Charter demanded an effective
  popular suffrage. The uncompromising rigidity with which such
  an extension of the vote was rejected by the Reformed Parliament
  for a third of a century, the use of force in view of the mass
  support that was manifest for the Charter, the abhorrence in
  which the liberals of the 1840's held the idea of popular government
  all prove that the concept of democracy was foreign to the English
  middle classes. Only when the working class had accepted the
  principles of a capitalist economy and the trade unions had made
  the smooth running of industry their chief concern did the middle
  classes concede the vote to the better situated workers; that
  is, long after the Chartist Movement had subsided and it had
  become certain that the workers would not try to use the franchise
  in the service of any ideas of their own. From the point of view
  of the spreading of the market forms of existence this may have
  been justified, since it helped to overcome the obstacles presented
  by the surviving organic and traditional forms of life among
  the laboring people. As to the entirely different task of restoring
  the common people, whose lives had been uprooted in the Industrial
  Revolution, and inducting them into the fold of a common national
  culture, it was left undone. Their investment with the vote at
  a time when irreparable damage had already been inflicted upon
  their capacity for sharing in leadership, could not retrieve
  the position. The ruling classes had committed the error of extending
  the principle of uncompromising class rule to a type of civilization
  which demanded the cultural and educational unity of the commonwealth
  if it should be safe from degenerative influences. (172)</P>
  <P>The Chartist Movement was political and thus easier to comprehend
  than Owenism. Yet it is doubtful whether the emotional intensity,
  or even the extent of that movement can be realized without some
  imaginative reference to the times. The years 1789 and 1830 had
  made revolution a regular institution in Europe; in 1848, the
  date of the Paris rising was actually forecast in Berlin and
  London with a precision more usual in regard to the opening of
  a fair than to a social upheaval, and &quot;follow-up&quot; revolutions
  broke out promptly in Berlin, Vienna, Budapest, and some towns
  of Italy. In London also there was high tension, for everybody,
  including the Chartists themselves, expected violent action to
  compel Parliament to grant the vote to the people. (Less than
  15 per cent of adult males were entitled to vote.) Never in all
  the history of England was there a comparable concentration of
  force put in readiness for the defense of law and order than
  on April 12, 1848; hundreds of thousands of citizens were prepared
  in the capacity of special constables to turn their arms against
  the Chartists on that day. The Paris Revolution came too late
  to carry a popular movement in England to victory. By that time
  the spirit of revolt roused by the Poor Law Reform Act as well
  as by the sufferings of the Hungry Forties was waning; the wave
  of rising, trade was boosting employment, and capitalism began
  to deliver the goods. The Chartists dispersed peacefully. Their
  case was not even considered by Parliament until a later date,
  when their application was defeated by a five-to-one majority
  in the House of Commons. In vain had millions of signatures been
  collected. In vain had the Chartists behaved as law-abiding citizens.
  Their Movement was ridiculed out of existence by the victors.
  Thus ended the greatest political effort of the people of England
  to constitute that country a popular democracy. A year or two
  later Chartism was all but forgotten. (172, 173)</P>
  <P>The Induitrial Revolution reached the Continent half a century
  later. There the working class had not been forced off the land
  by an enclosure movement; rather, the allurements of higher wages
  and urban life made the semiservile agricultural laborer desert
  the manor and migrate to the town, where he consorted with the
  traditional lower middle class, and had a chance of acquiring
  an urban tone. Far from feeling debased, he felt elevated by
  his new environment. Doubtless housing conditions were abominable,
  alcoholism and prostitution were rampant among the lower strata
  of town laborers as late as the beginning of the twentieth century.
  Yet there was no comparison between the moral and cultural catastrophe
  of the English cottager or copyholder of decent ancestry, who
  found himself hopelessly sinking in the social and physical mire
  of the slums of some factory neighborhood and the Slovakian or,
  for that matter, Pomeranian agricultural laborer changing almost
  overnight from a stable-dwelling peon into an industrial worker
  in a modern metropolis. An Irish or Welsh day laborer or Western
  Highlander might have had a similar experience when slouching
  through the alleys of early Manchester or Liverpool, but the
  English yeoman's son or the evicted cottager certainly did not
  feel his status raised. Yet not only had the recently emancipated
  peasant lout of the Continent a fair chance of rising into the
  lower middle classes of craftsmen and traders with their ancient
  cultural traditions, but even the bourgeoisie, which socially
  towered above him, was politically in the same boat being almost
  as removed from the ranks of the actual ruling class as he was
  himself. Against feudal aristocracy and Roman episcopacy the
  forces of the rising middle and working classes were closely
  allied. The intelligentsia, particularly the university students,
  cemented the union between these two classes in their common
  attack on absolutism and privilege. In England the middle classes,
  whether squires and merchants as in the seventeenth century,
  or farmers and tradesmen as in the nineteenth, were strong enough
  to vindicate their rights alone, and not even in their near-
  revolutionary effort in 1832 did they look to the laborers for
  support. Moreover, the English aristocracy unfailingly assimilated
  the wealthiest of the newcomers and broadened the top ranks of
  the social hierarchy, while on the Continent the still semifeudal
  aristocracy did not intermarry with the sons and daughters of
  the bourgeoisie, and the absence of the institution of primogeniture
  hermetically insulated them from the other classes. Every successful
  step towards equal rights and liberties thus benefited Continental
  middle and working classes alike. Since 1830, if not since 1789,
  it was part of the Continental tradition that the working class
  would help to fight the battles of the bourgeoisie against feudalism,
  if only - as the saying ran - to be cheated by the middle class
  of the fruits of victory. But whether the working class won or
  lost, its experience was enhanced, and its aims raised to a political
  level. This was what was meant by becoming class conscious. Marxian
  ideologies crystallized the outlook of the urban worker, who
  had been taught by circumstances to use his industrial and political
  strength as a weapon of high policy. While the British workers
  developed an incomparable experience in the personal and social
  problems of unionism, including the tactics and strategy of industrial
  action, and left national politics to their betters, the Central
  European worker became a political socialist, used to handle
  problems of statecraft - primarily, it is true, those which concerned
  his own interests, such as factory laws and social legislation.

  <P>If there was a time-lag of some half a century between the
  industrialization of Great Britain and that of the Continent,
  there was a very much greater lag between the establishment of
  national unity. Italy and Germany arrived only during the second
  half of the nineteenth century at that stage of unification which
  England and achieved centuries before, and smaller Eastern Europe
  states reached even later. In this process of state building
  the working classes played a vital part, which further enhanced
  their political experience. In the industrial age such a process
  could not fail to comprise social policy. Bismarck made a bid
  for unification of the Second Reich through the introduction
  of an epochal scheme of social legislation. Italian unity was
  speeded up by the nationalization of the railways. In the Austro-Hungarian
  monarchy, that congeries of races and peoples, the Crown itself
  repeatedly appealed to the laboring classes for support in the
  work of centralization and imperial unity. In this wider sphere
  also, through their influence on legislation, the socialist parties
  and trade unions found many openings for serving the interests
  of the industrial worker. (175)</P>
  <P>Materialistic preconceptions have blurred the outlines of
  the working-class problem. British writers have found it difficult
  to comprehend the terrible impression that early capitalistic
  conditions in Lancashire made on Continental observers. They
  pointed to the even lower standard of life of many Central European
  artisans in the textile industries, whose conditions of work
  were often perhaps just as bad as those of their English comrades.
  Yet such a comparison obscured the salient point, which was precisely
  the rise in the social and political status of the laborer on
  the Continent in contrast to a fall in that status in England.
  The Continental laborer had not passed through the degrading
  pauperization of Speenhamland nor was there any parallel in his
  experience to the scorching fires of the New Poor Law. From the
  status of a villein he changed - or rather rose - to that of
  a factory worker, and very soon to that of an enfranchised and
  unionized worker. Thus he escaped the cultural catastrophe which
  followed in the wake of the Industrial Revolution in England.
  Moreover, the Continent was industrialized at a time when adjustment
  to the new productive techniques had already become possible,
  thanks, almost exclusively, to the imitation of English methods
  of social protection. (Knowles, L., The Industrial and Commercial
  Revolution in Great Britain During the 19th Century, 1926) (175)</P>
  <P>The Continental worker needed protection not so much against
  the impact of the Industrial Revolution - in the social sense
  there never was such a thing on the Continent - as against the
  normal action of factory and labor market conditions. He achieved
  it mainly by the help of legislation, while his British comrades
  relied more on voluntarry association - trade unions - and their
  power to monopolize labor. Social insurance came, relatively,
  very much sooner on the Continent than in England. The difference
  was readily explained by the Continental's political bent, and
  by the comparatively early extension of the vote to the working
  masses on the Continent. While economically the difference between
  compulsory and voluntary methods of protection legislation versus
  unionism can be easily overrated, politically its consequences
  were great. On the Continent trade unions were a creation of
  the political party of the working class; in England the political
  party was a creation of the trade unions. While on the Continent
  unionism became more or less socialist, in England even political
  socialism remained essentially trade unionist. Universal suffrage,
  therefore, which in England tended to increase national unity,
  had sometimes the opposite effect on the Continent. There, rather
  than in England, did Pitt's and Peel's, Tocqueville's and Macaulay's
  misgivings come true that popular government would involve a
  danger to the economic system. (176)</P>
  <P>Economically, English and Continental methods of social protection
  led to almost identical results. They achieved what had been
  intended: the disruption of the market for that factor of production
  known as labor power. Such a market could serve its purpose only
  if wages fell, parallel with prices. In human terms such a postulate
  implied for the worker extreme instability of earnings, utter
  absence of professional standards, abject readiness to be shoved
  and pushed about indiscriminately, complete dependence on the
  whims of the market. Mises justly argued that if workers &quot;did
  not act as trade unionists, but reduced their demands and changed
  their locations and occupations according to the requirements
  of the labor market, they could eventually find work.&quot; This
  sums up the position under a system based on the postulate of
  the commodity character of labor. It is not for the commodity
  to decide where it should be offered for sale, to what purpose
  it should be used, at what price it should be allowed to change
  hands, and in what manner it should be consumed or destroyed.
  &quot;It has occurred to no one,&quot; this consistent liberal
  wrote, &quot;that lack of wages would be a better term than lack
  of employment, for what the unemployed person misses is not work
  but the remuneration of work.&quot; Mises was right, though he
  should not have claimed originality; 150 years prior to him Bishop
  Whately said: &quot;When a man begs for work he asks not for
  work but for wages.&quot; Yet, it is true that technically speaking
  &quot;unemployment in the capitalist countries is due to the
  fact that the policy both of the government and of the trade
  unions aims at maintaining a level of wages which is out of harmony
  with the existing productivity of labor.&quot; For how could
  there be unemployment, Mises asked, but for the fact that the
  workers are &quot;not willing to work at the wages they could
  get in the labor market for the particular work they were able
  and willing to perform?&quot; This makes clear what the employers'
  demand for mobility of labor and flexibility of wages really
  means: precisely that which we circumscribed above as a market
  in which human labor is a commodity. (176, 177)</P>
  <P>The natural aim of all social protection was to destroy such
  an institution and make its existence impossible. Actually, the
  labor market was allowed to retain its main function only on
  condition that wages and conditions of work, standards and regulations
  should be such as would safeguard the human character of the
  alleged commodity, labor. To argue that social legislation, factory
  laws, unemployment insurance, and, above all, trade unions have
  not interfered with the mobility of labor and the flexibility
  of wages, as is sometimes done, is to imply that those institutions
  halve entirely failed in their purpose, which was exactly that
  of interfering with the laws of supply and demand in respect
  to human labor, and removing it from the orbit of the market.
