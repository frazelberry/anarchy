<P>Chapter IV, <I>SOCIETIES AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS </I>(pp 43 -
55)</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Before we can proceed to the discussion of the laws governing
  a market economy, such as the nineteenth century was trying to
  establish, we must first have a firm grip on the extraordinary
  assumptions underlying such a system. (43)</P>
  <P>Market economy implies a self-regulating system of markets;
  in slightly more technical terms, it is an economy directed by
  market prices and nothing but market prices. Such a system capable
  of organizing the whole of economic life without outside help
  or interference would certainly deserve to be called self-regulating.
  These rough indications should suffice to show the entirely unprecedented
  nature of such a venture in the history of the race. (43)</P>
  <P>Let us make our meaning more precise. No society could, naturally,
  live for any length of time unless it possessed an economy of
  some sort; but previously to our time no economy has ever existed
  that, even in principle, was controlled by markets. In spite
  of the chorus of academic incantations so persistent in the nineteenth
  century, gain and profit made on exchange never before played
  an important part in human economy. Though the institution of
  the market was fairly common since the later Stone Age, its role
  was no more than incidental to economic life. (43)</P>
  <P>We have good reason to insist on this point with all the emphasis
  at our command. No less a thinker than Adam Smith suggested that
  the division of labor in society was dependent upon the existence
  of markets, or, as he puts it, upon man&#146;s &#147;propensity
  to barter, truck and exchange one thing for another.&quot; This
  phrase was later to yield the concept of the Economic Man. In
  retrospect it can be said that no misreading of the past ever
  proved more prophetic of the future. For while up to Adam Smith's
  time that propensity had hardly shown up on a considerable scale
  in the life of any observed community, and had remained, at best,
  a subordinate feature of economic life, a hundred years later
  an industrial system was in full swing over the major part of
  the planet which, practically and theoretically, implied that
  the human race was swayed in all its economic activities, if
  not also in its political intellectual, and spiritual pursuits,
  by that one particular propensity. Herbert Spencer, in the second
  half of the nineteenth century, could without more than a cursory
  acquaintance with economics, equate the principle of the division
  of labor with barter and exchange, and another fifty years later,
  Ludwig von Mises and Walter Lippmann could repeat the same fallacy.
  By that time there was no need for argument. A host of writers
  on political economy, social history, political philosophy, and
  general sociology had followed in Smith's wake and established
  his paradigm of the bartering savage as an axiom of their respective
  sciences. In point of fact, Adam Smith's suggestions about the
  economic psychology of early man were as false as Rousseau's
  were on the political psychology of the savage. Division of labor,
  a phenomenon as old as society, springs from differences inherent
  in the facts of sex, geography, and individual endowment; and
  the alleged propensity of man to barter, truck, and exchange
  is almost entirely apocryphal. While history and ethnography
  know of various kinds of economies, most of them comprising the
  institution of markets they know of no economy prior to our own,
  even approximately controlled and regulated by markets. This
  will become abundantly clear from a bird's-eye view of the history
  of economic systems and of markets, presented separately. The
  role played by markets in the internal economy of the various
  countries it will appear, was insignificant up to recent times
  and the changeover to an economy dominated by the market pattern
  will stand out all the more clearly. (43, 44)</P>
  <P>To start with, we must discard some nineteenth century prejudice,
  that underlay Adam Smith's hypothesis about primitive man's alleged
  predilection for gainful occupations. Since his axiom was much
  more relevant to the immediate future than to the dim past, it
  induced in his followers a strange attitude toward man's early
  history. On the face of it, the evidence seemed to indicate that
  primitive man, far from having a capitalistic psychology, had,
  in effect, a communistic one (later this also proved to be mistaken).
  Consequently, economic historians tended to confine their interest
  to that comparatively recent period of history in which truck
  and exchange were found on any considerable scale, primitive
  economics was relegated to prehistory. Unconsciously, this led
  to a weighting of the scales in favor of a marketing psychology,
  for within the relatively short period of the last few centuries
  everything might be taken to tend towards the establishment of
  that which we eventually established, ie., a market system, irrespective
  of other tendencies which were temporarily submerged. The corrective
  of such a &#147;short-run&quot; perspective would obviously have
  been the linking up of economic history with social anthropology,
  a course which was consistently avoided. (44, 45)</P>
  <P>We cannot continue today on these lines. The habit of looking
  at the last ten thousand years as well as at the array of early
  societies as a mere prelude to the true history of our civilization
  which started approximately with the publication of the Wealth
  of Nations in 1776, is, to say the least, out of date. It is
  this episode which has come to a close in our days, and in trying
  to gauge the alternatives of the future, we should subdue our
  natural proneness to follow the proclivities of our fathers.
  But the same bias which made Adam Smith's generation view primeval
  man as bent on barter and truck induced their successors to disavow
  all interest in early man, as he was now known not to have indulged
  in those laudable passions. The tradition of the classical economists
  who attempted to base the law of the market on the alleged propensities
  of man in the state of nature, was replaced by an abandonment
  of all interest in the cultures of &quot;ucivilized&#148; man
  as irrelevant to an understanding of the problems of our age.
  (45)</P>
  <P>Such an attitude of subjectivism in regard to earlier civilizations
  should make no appeal to the scientific mind. The differences
  existing between civilized and &quot;uncivilized&quot; peoples
  have been vastly exaggerated, especially in the economic sphere.
  According to the historians, the forms of industrial life in
  agricultural Europe were, until recently, not much different
  from what they had been several thousand years Ever since the
  introduction of the plow &#150; essentially a large hoe drawn
  by animals &#150; the methods of agriculture remained substantially
  unaltered over the major part of Western and Central Europe until
  the beginning of the modern age. Indeed, the progress of civilization
  was, in these regions, mainly political intellectual and spiritual;
  in respect to material conditions, the Western Europe of 1100
  AD had hardly caught up with the Roman world of a thousand years
  before. Even later, change flowed more easily in the channels
  of statecraft, literature, and the arts, but particularly in
  those of religion and learning, than in those of industry. In
  its economics, medieval Europe was largely on a level with ancient
  Persia, India, or China, and certainly not rival in riches and
  culture the New Kingdom of Egypt, two thousand years before.
  Max Weber was the first among modern historians to protest against
  the brushing aside of primitive economics as irrelevant to the
  question of the motives and mechanisms of civilized societies.
  The subsequent work of social anthropology proved him emphatically
  right. For, if one conclusion stands out from the recent study
  of early societies it is the changelessness of man as a social
  being. His natural endowments reappear with societies of all
  times and places; and the necessary preconditions of the survival
  of human society appear to be immutably the same. (45, 46)</P>
  <P>The outstanding discovery of recent historical and anthropological
  research is that man's economy, as a rule, is submerged in his
  social relationships. He does not act so as to safeguard his
  individual interest in the possession of material goods; he acts
  so as to safeguard his social standing, his social claims, his
  social assets. He values material goods only in so far as they
  serve this end. Neither the process of production nor that of
  distribution is linked to specific economic interests attached
  to the possession of goods; but every single step in that process
  is geared to a number of social interests which eventually ensure
  that the required step be taken. these interests will be very
  different in a small hunting or fishing community from those
  in a vast despotic society, but in either case the economic system
  will be run on noneconomic motives.</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor40818"></A>The explanation, in term of survival,
  is simple. Take the case of a tribal society. The individual's
  economic interest is rarely paramount for the community keeps
  all its members from starving unless it is itself borne down
  by catastrophe, in which case interests are again threatened
  collectively, not individually. The maintenance of social ties,
  on the other hand, is crucial. First, because by disregarding
  the accepted code of honor, or generosity, the individual cuts
  himself off from the community and becomes an outcast; second,
  because, in the long run, all social obligations are reciprocal,
  and their fulfillment serves also the individual's give-and-take
  interests best. Such a situation must exert a continuous pressure
  on the individual to eliminate economic self-interest from his
  consciousness to the point of making him unable, in many cases
  (but by no means in all), even to comprehend the implication
  of his own actions in term of such an interest. This attitude
  is reinforced by the frequency of communal activities such as
  partaking of food from the common catch or sharing in the results
  of some far-flung and dangerous tribal expedition. The premium
  set on generosity is a great when measured in terms of social
  prestige as to make any other behavior than that of utter self-forgetfulness
  simply not pay. Personal character has little to do with the
  matter. Man can be as good or evil as social or asocial, jealous
  or generous, in respect to one another. Not to allow anybody
  reason for jealousy is, indeed, an accepted principle of ceremonial
  distribution, just as publicly bestowed praise is the due of
  the industrious, skillful, or otherwise successful gardener (unless
  he be too successful, in which case he may deservedly be allowed
  to wither away under the delusion of being the victim of black
  magic). The human passions, good or bad, are merely directed
  towards noneconomic ends. Ceremonial display serves to spur emulation
  to the utmost and the custom of communal labor tends to up both
  quantitative and qualitative standards to the highest pitch.
  The performance of all acts of exchange as free gifts that are
  expected to be reciprocated though not necessarily by the same
  individuals &#150; a procedure minutely articulated and perfectly
  safeguarded by elaborate methods of publicity, by magic rites,
  and by the establishment of &quot;dualities&quot; in which groups
  arc linked in mutual obligations &#150; should in itself explain
  the absence of the notion of gain or even of wealth other than
  that consisting of objects traditionally enhancing social prestige.
  (46, 47)</P>
  <P>In this sketch of the general traits characteristic of a Western
  Melanesian community we took no account of its sexual and territorial
  organization, in reference to which custom, law, magic, and religion
  exert their influence, as we only intended to show the manner
  in which so-called economic motives spring from the context of
  social life. For it is on this one negative point that modern
  ethnographers agree: the absence of the motive of gain; the absence
  of the principle of laboring for remuneration; the absence of
  the principle of least effort; and, especially, the absence of
  any separate and distinct institution based on economic motives.
  But how, then, is order in production and distribution ensured?
  The answer is provided in the main by two principles of behavior
  not primarily associated with economics: reciprocity, and redistribution.
  With the Trobriand Islanders of Western Melanesia, who serve
  as an illustration of this type of economy, reciprocity works
  mainly in regard to the sexual organization of society, that
  is, family and kinship; redistribution is mainly effective in
  respect to all those who are under a common chief and is, therefore,
  of a territorial character. Let us take these principles separately.
  (47)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor404348"></A>The sustenance of the family -
  the female and the children - is the obligation of matrilineal
  relatives. The male, who provides for his sister, and her family
  by delivering the finest specimens of his crop, will mainly earn
  credit due to his good behavior, but will reap little immediate
  material benefit in exchange; if he is slack, it is first and
  foremost his reputation that will suffer. It is for the benefit
  of his wife and her children that the principle of reciprocity
  will work, and thus compensate him economically for his acts
  of civic virtue. Ceremonial display of food both in his own garden
  and before the recipient's storehouse will ensure that the high
  quality of his gardening be known to all. It is apparent that
  the economy of garden and household here forms part of the social
  relations connected with good husbandry and fine citizenship.
  The broad principle of reciprocity helps to safeguard both production
  and family sustenance. (47, 48)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor468756"></A>The principle of redistribution
  is no less effective. A substantial part of all the produce of
  the island is delivered by the village headmen to the chief who
  keeps it in storage. But as all communal activity centers around
  the feasts, dances, and other occasions when the islanders entertain
  one another as well as their neighbors from other islands (at
  which the results of long distance trading are handed out, gifts
  are given and reciprocated according to the rules of etiquette,
  and the chief distributes the customary presents to all), the
  overwhelming importancc of the storage system becomes apparent.
  Economically, it is an essential part of the existing system
  of division of labor, of foreign trading, of taxation for public
  purposes, of defense provisions. But these functions of an economic
  system proper are completely absorbed by the intensely vivid
  experiences which offer superabundant non-economic motivation
  for every act performed in the frame of the system as a whole.
  (48)</P>
  <P>However, principles of behavior such as these cannot become
  effective unless existing institutional patterns lend themselves
  to their application. Reciprocity and redistribution are able
  to ensure the working of an economic system without the help
  of written records and elaborate administration only because
  the organization of the societies in question meets the requirements
  of such a solution with the help of patterns such as symmetry
  and centricity. (48)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor72465"></A>Reciprocity is enormously facilitated
  by the institutional pattern of symmetry, a frequent feature
  of social organization among nonliterate peoples. The striking
  &#147;duality&#148; which we find in tribal subdivisions lends
  itself to the pairing out of individual relations and thereby
  assists the give-and-take of goods and services in the absence
  of permant records. The moieties of savage society which tend
  to create a &#147;pendant&#148;, to each subdivision, turned
  out to result from, as well as help to perform, the acts of reciprocity
  on which the system rests. Little is known of the origin of &quot;duality&quot;;
  but each coastal village on the Trobriand Islands appears to
  have its counterpart in an inland village, so that the important
  exchange of breadfruits and fish, though disguised as a reciprocal
  distribution of gifts, and actually disjoint in time, can be
  organized smoothly. In the Kula trade, too, each individual has
  his partner on another isle, thus personalizing to a remarkable
  extent the relationship of reciprocity. But for the frequency
  of the symmetrical pattern in the subdivisions of the tribe,
  in the location of settlements, as well as in intertribal relations,
  a broad reciprocity relying on the longrun working of separated
  acts of give-and-take would be impracticable. (48, 49)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor73424"></A><!--SELECTION-->The institutional
  pattern of centricity, again, which is present to some extent
  in all human groups, provides a track for the collection, storage,
  and redistribution of goods and services. The members of a hunting
  tribe usually deliver the game to the headman for redistribution.
  It is in the nature of hunting that the output of game is irregular,
  besides being the result of a collective input. Under conditions
  such as these no other method of sharing is practicable if the
  group is not to break up after every hunt. Yet in all economies
  of kind a similar need exists, be the group ever so numerous.
  And the larger the territory and the more varied the produce,
  the more will redistribution result in an effective division
  of labor, since it must help to link up geographically differentiated
  groups of producers. (49)<!--/SELECTION--></P>
  <P>Symmetry and centricity will meet halfway the needs of reciprocity
  and redistribution; institutional patterns and principles of
  behavior are mutually adjusted. As long as social organization
  runs in its ruts, no individual economic motives need come into
  play; no shirking of personal effort need be feared; division
  of labor will automatically be ensured; economic obligations
  will be duly discharged; and, above all, the material means for
  an exuberant display of abundance at all public festivals will
  be provided. In such a community the idea of profit is barred;
  higgling and haggling is decried; giving freely is acclaimed
  as a virtue; the supposed properisity to barter, truck, and exchange
  does not appear. The economic system is, in effect, a mere function
  of social organization. (49)</P>
  <P>It should by no means be inferred that socioeconomic principles
  of this type are restricted to primitive procedures or small
  communities; that a gainless and marketless economy must necessarily
  be simple. The Kula ring, in western Melanesia, based on the
  principle of reciprocity, is one of the most elaborate trading
  transactions known to man; and redistribution was present on
  a gigantic scale in the civilization of the pyramids. (49, 50)</P>
  <P>The Trobriand Islands belong to an archipelago forming roughly
  a circle, and an important part of the population of this archipelago
  spends a considerable proportion of its time in activities of
  the Kula trade. We describe it as trade though no profit is involved,
  either in money or in kind; no goods are hoarded or even possessed
  permanently; the goods received are enjoyed by giving them away;
  no biggling and haggling, no truck, barter, or exchange enters;
  and the whole proceedings are entirely regulated by etiquette
  and magic. Still, it is trade, and large expeditions are undertaken
  periodically by natives of this approximately ring-shaped archipelago
  in order to carry one kind of valuable object to peoples living
  on distant islands situated clockwise, while other expeditions
  are arranged carrying another kind of valuable object to the
  islands of the archipelago lying counterclockwise. In the long
  run, both sets of objects-whitc-shell ai-mbands and redshell
  necklaces of traditional make-will move round the archipelago,
  a traject which may take them up to ten years to complete. Moreover,
  there are, as a rule, individual partners in Kula who reciprocate
  one anothees Kula gift with equally valuable armbands and necklaces,
  referably such that have previously belonged to distinguished
  persons. Now, a systematic and organized give-and-take of valuable
  objects transported over long distances is justly described as
  trade. Yet this complex whole is exclusively run on the lines
  of reciprocity. An intricate time-space-person system covering
  hundreds of miles and several decades, linking many hundreds
  of people in respect to thousands of strictly individual objects,
  is being handled here without any records or administration,
  but also without any motive of gain or truck. Not the propensity
  to barter, but reciprocity in social behavior dominates. Nevertheless,
  the result is a stupendous organizational achievement in onomic
  field Indeed, it would be interesting to consider whether even
  the most advanced modem market organization, based on exact accountancy,
  would be able to cope with such a task, should it care to undertake
  it. It is to be feared that the<BR>
  unfortunate dealers, faced innummerable monopolists buying and
  selling individual objects with with extravagant restrictions
  attached to each transaction, would fail to make a standar profit
  and might prefer to go out of business. (50)</P>
  <P>Redistribution also has its long and variegated history which
  leadsup almost to modern times. The Bergdama returning from his
  hunting excursion, the woman coming back from her search for
  roots, fruit, or leaves are expected to offer the greater part
  of their spoil for the benefit of the community. In practice,
  this means that the produce of their activity is shared with
  the other persons who happen to be living with them. Up to this
  point the idea of reciprocity prevails: today's giving will be
  recompensed by tomorrow's taking. Among some tribes, however,
  there is an intermediary in the person of the headman or other
  prominent member of the group; it is he who receives and distributes
  the supplies, especially if they need to be stored. This is redistribution
  proper. Obviously, the social consequences of such a method of
  distribution may be far reaching, since not all societies are
  as democratic as the primitive hunters. Whether the redistributing
  is performed by an, influential family or an outstanding individual,
  a ruling aristocracy or a group of bureaucrats, they will often
  attempt to increase their political power by the manner in which
  they redistribute the goods. In the potlatch of the Kwakiutl
  it is a point of honor with the chief to display his wealth of
  hides and to distribute them; but he does this also in order
  to place the recipients under an obligation, to make them his
  debtors,' and ultimately, his retainers. (51)</P>
  <P>All large-scale economies in kind were run with the help of
  the principle of redistribution. The kingdom of Hammurabi in
  Babylonia and, in particular, the New Kingdom of Egypt were centralized
  despotisms of a bureaucratic type founded on such an economy.
  The household of the patriarchal family was reproduced here on
  an enormously enlarged scale, while its &quot;communistic&quot;
  distribution was graded, involving sharply differentiated rations.
  A vast number of storehouses was ready to receive the produ-ce
  of the peasant's activity, whether he was cattle breeder, hunter,
  baker, brewer, potter, weaver, or whatever else. The produce
  was minutely registered and, in so far as it was not consumed
  locally, transferred from smaller to larger storehouses until
  it reached the central administration situated at the court of
  the Pharaoh. There were separate treasure houses for cloth, works
  of art, ornamental objects, cosmetics, silverware, the royal
  wardrobe; there were huge grain stores, arsenals, and wine cellars.(51)</P>
  <P>But redistribution on the scale practiced by the pyramid builders
  was not restricted to economies which knew not money. Indeed,
  all archaic kingdoms made use of metal currencies for the payment
  of taxes and salaries, but relied for the rest on payments in
  kind from granaries and warehouses of every description, from
  which they distributed the most varied goods for use and consumption
  mainly to the nonproducing part of the population, that is, to
  the officials, the military, and the leisure class. This was
  the system practiced in ancient China, in the empire, of the
  Incas, in the kingdoms of India, and also in Babylonia. In these,
  and many other civilizations of vast economic achievement, an
  elaborate division of labor was worked by the mechanism of redistribution.(51,
  52)</P>
  <P>Under feudal conditions also this principle held. In the ethnically
  stratified societies of Africa it sometimes happens that the
  superior a consist of herdsmen settled among agriculturalists
  who are still strating the digging stick or the hoe. The gifts
  collected by the herdsmen usare mainly agricultural - such as
  cereals and beer - while the gifts distributed by them may be
  animals, especially sheep or goats. In these cases there is division
  of labor, though usually an unequal one, between the various
  strata of society: distribution may often cover up a measure
  of exploitation, while at the same time the symbiosis benefits
  the standards of both strata owing to the advantages of an improved
  division of labor. Politically, such societies live under a regime
  of feudalism, whether cattle or land be the privileged value.
  There are &quot;regular cattle fiefs in East Africa.&quot; Thurnwald,
  whom we follow closely on the subject of redistribution, could
  therefore say that feudalism implied everywhere a system of redistribution.
  Only under very advanced conditions and exceptional circumstances
  does this system become predominantly political as happened in
  Western Europe, where the change arose out pof the vassal's need
  for protection, and gifts were converted into feudal tributes.(52)</P>
  <P>These instances show that redistribution also tends to enmesh
  the economic system proper in social relationships. We find,
  as a rule, the process of redistribution forming part of the
  prevailing political regime, whether it be that of tribe, city-state,
  despotism, or feudalism of cattle or land. The production and
  distribution of goods is organized in themain through collection,
  storage, and redistribution, the pattern being focused on the
  chief, the temple, the despot, or the lord. Since the relations
  of the leading group to the led are different according to the
  foundation on which political power rests, the principle of redistribution
  will involve individual motives as different as the voluntary
  sharing of the game by hunters and the dread of punishment which
  urges the <I>fellaheen</I> to deliver his taxes in kind. (52)</P>
  <P>We deliberately disregarded in this presentation the vital
  distinction between homogeneous and stratified societies, i.e.,
  societies which are on the whole socially unified, and such as
  are split into rulers and ruled. Though the relative status of
  slaves and masters may be worlds apart from that of the free
  and equal members of some hunting tribes, and consequently, motives
  in the two societies will differ widely, the organization of
  the economic system may still be based on the same principles,
  though accompanied by very different culture traits, according
  to the very different human relations with which the economic
  system is intertwined.(52, 53)</P>
  <P>The third principle, which was destined to play a big role
  in history and which we will call the principle of householding,
  consists in production for one's own use. The Greeks called it
  oeconomia, the etymon of the word &quot;economy.&quot; As far
  as ethnographical records are concerned, we should not assume
  that production for a person's or group's own sake is more ancient
  than reciprocity or redistribution. On the contrary, orthodox
  tradition as well as some more recent theories on the subject
  have been emphatically disproved. The individualistic savage
  collecting food and hunting on his own or for his family has
  neverexisted. Indeed, the practice of catering for the needs
  of one's household becomes a feature of economic life only on
  a more advanced level of agriculture; however, even then it has
  nothing in common either with the motive of gain or with the
  institution of markets. Its patterrn is the closed group. Whether
  the very different entities of the family or the settlement or
  the manor formed the self-sufficient unit, the principle was
  invariably the same, namely, that of producing and storing for
  the satisfaction of the wants of the members of the group. The
  principle is as broad in its application as either reciprocity
  or redistribution. The nature of the institutional nucleus is
  indifferent: it may be sex as with the patriarchal family, locality
  as with the village settlement, or political power as with the
  seigneurial manor. Nor does the internal organization of the
  group matter. It may be as despotic as the Roman familia or as
  democratic as the South Slav zadruga; as large as the, great
  domains of the Carolingian magnates or as small as the average
  peasant holding of Western Europe. The need for trade or markets
  is, no greater than in the case of reciprocity or redistribution.(52,
  53)</P>
  <P>It is such a condition of affairs which Aristotle tried to
  establish as a norm more than two thousand years ago. Looking
  back from the rapidly declining heights of a world-wide market
  economy we must concede that his famous distinction of householding
  proper and moneymaking, in the introductory chapter of his Politics,
  was probably the most prophetic pointer ever made in the realm
  of the social sciences; it is certainly still the best analysis
  of the subject we possess. Aristotle insists on production for
  use as against production for gain as the essence of householding
  proper; yet accessory production for the market need not, he
  argues, destroy the self-sufficiency of the household as long
  as the cash crop would also otherwise be raised on the farm for
  sustenance, as cattle or grain; the sale of the surpluses need
  not destroy the basis of householding. Only a genius of common
  sense could have maintained, as he did, that gain was a motive
  peculiar to production for the market, and that the money factor
  introduced a new element into the situation, yet nevertheless,
  as long as markets and money were mere accessories to an otherwise
  self-sufficient household, the principle of production for use
  could operate. Undoubtedly, in this he was right, though he failed
  to see how impracticable it was to ignore the existence of markets
  at a time when Greek economy had made itself dependent upon wholesale
  trading and loaned capital. For this was the century when Delos
  and Rhodes were developing into emporia of freight insurance,
  sea-loans, and giro-banking, compared with which the Western
  Europe of a thousand years later was the very picture of primitivity.
  Yet Jowett, Master of Balliol, was grievously mistaken when he
  took it for granted that his Victorian England had a fairer grasp
  than Aristotle of the nature of the difference between householding
  and moneymaking. He excused Aristotle by conceding that the &quot;subjects
  of knowledge that are concerned with man run into one another;
  and in the age of Aristotle were not easily distinguished.&quot;
  Aristotle, it is true, did not recognize clearly the implications
  of the division of labor and its connection with markets and
  money; nor did he realize the uses of money as credit and capital.
  So far Jowett&#146;s strictures were justified. But it was the
  Master of Balliol, not Aristotle, who was impervious to the human
  implications of money-making. He failed to see that thet distinction
  between the principle of use and that of gain was the key to
  the utterly different civilization the outlines of which Aristotle
  accurately forecast two thousand years before its advent out
  of the bare rudiments of a market economy available to him, while
  Jowett, with the full-blown specimen before him, overlooked its
  existence. In denouncing the principle of production for gain
  &quot;as not natural to man,&quot; as boundless and limitless,
  Aristotle was, in effect, aiming at the crucial point, namely
  the divorcedness of a separate economic motive from the social
  relations in which these limitations inhered. (53, 54)</P>
  <P>Broadly, the proposition holds that all economic systems known
  to us up to the end of feudalism in Western Europe were organized
  either on the principles of reciprocity or redistribution, or
  houscholding, or some combination of the three. These principles
  were institutionalized with the help of a social organization
  which, inter alia, made use of the patterns of symmetry, centricity,
  and autarchy. In this framework, the orderly production and distribution
  of goods was secured through a great variety of individual motives
  disciplined by general principles of behavior. Among these motives
  gain was not prominent. Custom and law, magic and religion co-operated
  in inducing the individual to comply with rules of behavior which,
  eventually, ensured his functioning in the economic system. (54,
  55)</P>
  <P>The Greco-Roman period, in spite of its highly developed trade,
  represented no break in this respect; it was characterized by
  the grand scale on which redistribution of grain was practiced
  by the Roman administration in an otherwise householding economy,
  and it formed no exception to the rule that up to the end of
  the Middle Ages, markets played no important part in the economic
  system; other institutional patterns prevailed.(55)</P>
  <P>From the sixteenth century onwards markets were both numerous
  and important. Under the mercantile system they became, in effect,
  a main concern of government; yet there was still no sign of
  the coming control of markets over human society. On the contrary.
  Regulation and regimentation were stricter than ever; the very
  idea of a self-regulating market was absent. To comprehend the
  sudden changever to an utterly new type of economy in the nineteenth
  century, we must now turn to the history of the market, an institution
  we were able practically to neglect in our review of the economic
  systems of the past. (55)<BR>
