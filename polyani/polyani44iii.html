<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>AT THE HEART of the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth
century there was an almost miraculous improvement in the tools
of production, which was accompanied by a catastrophic dislocation
of the lives of the common people. (33)</P>

<P>We will attempt to disentangle the factors that determined
the forms of this dislocation, as it appeared at its worst in
England about a century ago. What &quot;satanic mill&quot; ground
men into masses? How much was caused by the new physical conditions?
How much by the economic dependencies, operating under the new
conditions? And what was the mechanism through which the old social
tissue was destroyed and a new integration of man and nature so
unsuccessfully attempted? (33)</P>

<P>Nowhere has liberal philosophy failed so conspicuously as in
its understanding of the problem of change. Fired by an emotional
faith in spontaneity, the common-sense attitude toward change
was discarded in favor of a mystical readiness to accept the social
consequences of economic improvement, whatever they might be.
The elementary truths of political science and statecraft were
first discredited, then forgotten. It should need no elaboration
that a process of undirected change, the pace of which is deemed
too fast, should be slowed down, if possible, so as to safeguard
the welfare of the community. Such household truths of traditional
statesmanship, often merely reflecting the teachings of a social
philosophy inherited from the ancients, were in the nineteenth
century erased from the thoughts of the educated by the corrosive
of a crude utilitarianism combined with an uncritical reliance
on the alleged self-healing virtues of unconscious growth. (33)</P>

<P>Economic liberalism misread the history of the Industrial Revolution
because it insisted on judging social events from the economic
viewpoint. For an illustration of this we shall turn to what may
at first seem a remote subject: to enclosures of open fields and
conversions of arable land to pasture during the earlier Tudor
period in Engand, when fields and commons were hedged by the lords,
and whole counties were threatened by depopulation. Our purpose
in thus evoking the plight of the people brought about by enclosures
and conversions will be on the one hand to demonstrate the parallel
between the devastations caused by the ultimately beneficial enclosures
and those resulting from the Industrial Revolution, and on the
other hand - and more broadly - to clarify the alternatives facing
a community which is in the throes of unregulated economic improvement.
(33, 34)</P>

<P>Enclosures were an obvious improvement if no conversion to
pasture took place. Enclosed land was worth double and treble
the unenclosed. Where tillage was maintained, employment did not
fall off and the food supply markedly increased. The yield of
the land manifestly increased, especially where the land was let.
(34)</P>

<P>But even conversion of arable land to sheep runs was not altogether
detrimental to the neighborhood in spite of the destruction of
habitations and the restriction of employment it involved. Cottage
industry was spreading by the second half of the fifteenth century,
and a century later it began to be a feature of the countryside.
The wool produced on the sheep farm gave employment to the small
tenants and landless cottagers forced out of tillage, and the
new centers of the woolen industry secured an income to a number
of craftsmen. (34)</P>

<P>But - this is the point - only in a market economy can such
cornpensatin g effects be taken for granted. In the absence of
such an economy the highly profitable occupation of raising sheep
and selling their wool might ruin the country. The sheep which
&quot;turned 'sand into gold&quot; could well have turned the
gold into sand as happened ultimately to the wealth of seventeenth
century Spain whose eroded soil never recovered from the overexpansion
of sheep farming. (34)</P>

<P>An official document of 1607, prepared for the use of the Lords
of the Realm, set out the problem of change in one powerful phrase:
&quot;The poor man shall be satisfied in his end: Habitation;
and the gentleman not hindered in his desire: Improvement.&quot;
This formula appears to take for granted the essence of purely
economic progress, which is to achieve improvement at the price
of social dislocation. But it also hints at the tragic necessity
by which the poor an clings to his hovel, doomed by the rich man's
desire for a public improvement which profits him privately. (34)</P>

<P>Enclosures have appropriately been called a revolution of the
rich against the poor. The lords and nobles were upsetting the
social order, breaking down ancient law and custom, sometimes
by means of violence, often by pressure and intimidation. They
were literally robbing the poor of their share of the common,
tearing down the houses which, by the hitherto unbreakable force
of custom, the poor had long regarded as theirs and their heirs.
The fabric of society was being disrupted; desolate villages and
the ruins of human dwellings testified to the fierceness with
which the revolution raged, endangering the defenses of the burdened
soil into dust, harassing its people and turning them from decent
husbandmen into a mob of beggars and thieves. Though this happened
only in patches, the black spots threatened to melt into a uniform
catastrophe. The King and his Council, the Chancellors, and the
Bishops were defending the welfare of the community and, indeed,
the human and natural substance of society against this scourge.
With hardly any intermittence, for a century and a half - from
the 1490&#146;s at the latest, to the 1640&#146;s - they struggled
against depopulation. Lord Protector Somerset lost his life at
the hands of the counterrevolution which wiped the enclosure laws
from the statute book and established the dictatorship of the
grazier lords, after Kett&#146;s Rebellion was defeated with several
thousand peasants slaughtered in the process. Somerset was accused,
and not without truth, of having given encouragement to the rebellious
peasants by his staunch denunciation of enclosures. (35)</P>

<P>It was almost a hundred years later when a second trial of
strength came between the same opponents, but by that time the
enclosers were much more frequently wealthy country gentlemen
and merchants rather than lords and nobles. High politics, lay
and ecclesiastical, were now involved in the Crown&#146;s deliberate
use of its prerogative to prevent enclosures and in its no less
deliberate use of the enclosure issue to strengthen its position
against the gentry in a constitutional struggle, which brought
death to Strafford and Laud at the hands of Parliament. But their
policy was not only industrially but politically reactionary;
furthermore, enclosures were now much more often than before intended
for tillage, and not for pasture. Presently the tide of the Civil
War engulfed Tudor and early Stuart public policy forever. (35)</P>

<P>Nineteenth century historians were unanimous in condeming Tudor
and Stuart policy as demogogic, if not outright reactionary. Their
sympathies lay, naturally, with Parliament and that body had been
on the side of the enclosers. H. de B. Gibbins, though an ardent
friend of the common people, wrote: &quot;Such protective enactments
were, however, as protective enactments generally be, utterly
vain.&#148; (Gibbins H. de B., The Industrial History of England,
1895) Innes was even more definite: &quot;The usual remedies of
punishing vagabondage and attempting to force industry into unsuited
fields and to drive capital into less lucrative investments in
order to provide employment failed - as usual.&quot; (Innes A.
D., England under the Tudors, 1932) Gairdner had no hesitation
in appealing to free trade notions as &quot;economic law&quot;:
&quot;Economic laws were, of course, not understood,&quot; he
wrote, &quot;and attempts were made by legislation to prevent
husbandmen's dwellings from being thrown down by landlords, who
found it profitable to devote arable land to pasture to increase
the growth of wool. The frequent repetition of these Acts only
show how ineffective they were in practice.&quot; (Gairdner, J.,
&quot;Henry VIII,&quot; Cambridge Modern History, Vol. II, igib.
Heckscher, E. F., Mercantilism, 1935, P. 104) Recently an economist
like Heckscher emphasizes his conviction that mercantilism should,
in the main, be explained by an insufficient understanding of
the complexities of economic phenomena, a subject which the human
mind obviously needed another few centuries to master. In effect,
anti-enclosure legislation never seemed to have stopped the course
of the enclosure movement, nor even to have obstructed it seriously.
John Hales, second to none in his fervor for the principles of
the Commonwealth men, admitted that it proved impossible to collect
evidence against the enclosers, who often had their servants sworn
upon the juries, and such was the number &quot;of their retainers
and hangers-on that no jury could be made without them.&quot;
Sometimes the simple expedient of driving a single furrow across
the field would save the offending lord from a penalty. (35, 36)</P>

<P>Such an easy prevailing of private interests over justice is
often regarded as a certain sign of the ineffectiveness of legislation,
and the victory of the vainly obstructed trend is subsequently
adduced as conclusivc evidence of the alleged futility of &quot;a
reactionary interventionism.&quot; Yet such a view seems to miss
the point altogether. Why should the ultimate victory of a trend
be taken as a proof of the ineffectiveness of the efforts to slow
down its progress? And why should the purpose of these measures
not be seen precisely in that which they achieved, i.e., in the
slowing down of the rate of change? That which is ineffectual
in stopping a line of development altogether is not, on that account,
altogether ineffectual. The rate of change is often of no less
than the direction of the change itself but while the latter frequently
does not depend upon our volition, it is the rate at which we
allow change to take place which, well may depend upon us. (36,
37)</P>

<P>A belief in spontaneous progress must make us blind to the
role of government in economic life. This role consists often
in altering the rate of change, speeding it up or slowing it down
as the case may be; if we believe that rate to be unalterable
- or even worse, if we deem it a sacrilege to interfere with it
- then, of course, no room is left for intervention. Enclosures
offer an example. In retrospect nothing could be clearer than
the Western European trend of economic progress which aimed at
eliminating an artificially maintained uniformity of agricultural
technique, intermixed strips, and the primitive institution of
the common. As to England, it is certain that the development
of the woolen industry was an asset to the country, leading, as
it did, to the establishment of the cotton industry - that vehicle
of the Industrial Revolution. Furthermore, it is clear that the
increase of domestic weaving depended upon the increase of a home
supply of wool. These facts suffice to identify the change from
arable land to pasture and the accompanying enclosure movement
as the trend of economic progress. Yet, but for the consistently
maintained policy of the Tudor and early Stuart statesmen, the
rate of that progress might have been ruinous, and have turned
the process itself into a degenerative instead of a constructive
event. For upon this rate, mainly, depended whether the dispossessed
could adjust themselves to changed conditions without fatally
damaging their substance, human and economic, physical and moral;
whether they would find new employment in the fields of opportunity
indirectly connected with the change; and whether the effects
of increased imports induced by increased exports would enable
those who lost their employment through the change to find new
sources of sustenance. (37)</P>

<P>The answer depended in every case on the relative rates of
change and adjustment. The usual &quot;long-run&quot; considerations
of economic theory are inadmissible; they would prejudge the issue
by assuming that the event took place in a market economy. However
natural it may appear to us to make that assumption, it is unjustified:
market economy is an institutional structure which, as we all
too easily forget, has been present at no time except our own,
and even then it was only partially present. Yet apart from this
assumption &quot;long-run&#148; considerations are meaningless.
If the immediate effect of a change is deleterious, then, until
proof to the contrary, the final effect is deleterious. If conversion
of arable land to pasture involves the destruction of a definite
number of houses, the scrapping of a definite amount of employment,
and the diminution of the supplies of locally available food provisions,
then these effects must be regarded as final, until evidence to
the contrary is produced. This does not exclude the consideration
of the possible effects of increased exports on the income of
the landowners; of the possible chances of employment created
by an eventual increase in the local wool supply; or of the uses
to which the land-owners might put their increased incomes, whether
in the way of further investments or of luxury expenditure. The
time-rate of change compared with the time-rate of adjustment
will decide what is to be regarded as the net effect of the change.
But in no cas can we assume the functioning of market laws unless
a self-regulating market is shown to exist. Only in the institutional
setting of market economy are market laws relevant; it was not
the statesmen of Tudor England who strayed from the facts, but
the modern economists, whose strictures upon them implied the
prior existence of a market system. (37, 38)</P>

<P>England withstood without grave damage of the calamity of the
enclosures only because the Tudors and the early Stuarts used
the powers of the Crown to slow down the process of economic improvement
until it became socially unbearable - employing the power of the
central government to relieve the victims of the transformation,
and attempting to canalize the process of change so as to make
its course less devastating . Their chancelleries and courts of
prerogative were anything but conservative in outlook; they represented
the scientific spirit of the new statecraft, favoring the immigration
of foreign craftsmen, eagerly implanting new techniques, adopting
statistical methods and precise habits of reporting, flouting
custom and tradition, opposing prescriptive rights, curtailing
ecclesiastical prerogatives, ignoring Common Law. If innovation
makes the revolutionary, they were the revolutionaries of the
age. Their commitment was to the welfare of the commonalty, glorified
in the power and grandeur of the sovereign; yet the future belonged
to constitutionalism and Parliament. The government of the Crown
gave place to government by a class-the class which led in industrial
and commercial progress. The great principle of constitutionalism
became wedded to the political revolution that dispossessed the
Crown, which by that time had shed almost all its creative faculties,
while its protective function was no longer vital to a country
that had weathered the storm of transition. The financial policy
of the Crown now restricted the power of the country unduly, and
began to contsrain its trade; in order to maintain its prerogatives
the Crown abused them more and more, and thereby harmed the resources
of the nation. Its brilliant administration of labor and industry,
its circumspect control of the enclosure movement, remained its
last achievement. But it was the more easily forgotten as the
capitalists and employers of the rising middle class were the
chief victims of its protective activities. Not till another two
centuries had passed did England enjoy again a social administration
as effective and well ordered as that which the Commonwealth destroyed.
Admittedly, an administration of this paternalistic kind was now
less needed. But in one respect the break wrought infinite harm,
for it helped to obliterate from the memory of the nation the
horrors of the enclosure period and the achievements of government
in overcoming the peril of depopulation. Perhaps this helps to
explain why the real nature of the crisis was not realized when,
some 150 years later, a similar catastrophe in the shape of the
Industrial Revolution threatened the life and well-being of the
country. (38, 39)</P>

<P>This time also the event was peculiar to England; this time
also sea-borne trade was the source of a movement which affected
the country as a whole; and this time again it was improvement
on the grandest scale which wrought unprecedented havoc with the
habitation of the common people. Before the process had advanced
very far, the laboring people had been crowded together in new
places of desolation, the so-called industrial towns of England;
the country folk had been dehumanized into slum dwellers; the
family was on the road to perdition; and large parts of the country
were rapidly disappearing under the slack and scrap heaps vomited
forth from the &quot;satanic mills.&quot; Writers of all views
and parties, conservatives and liberals, capitalists and socialists
invariably referred to social conditions under the Industrial
Revolution as a veritable abyss of human degradation. (39)</P>

<P>No quite satisfactory explanation of the event has yet been
put forward. Contemporaries imagined they had discovered the key
to damnation in the iron regularities governing wealth and poverty,
which they called the law of wages and the law of population;
they have been disproved. Exploitation was put forth as another
explanation both of wealth and of poverty; but this was unable
to account for the fact that wages in the industrial slums were
higher than those in any other areas and on the whole continued
to rise for another century. More often a convolute of causes
was adduced, which again was hardly satisfactory. (39)</P>

<P>Our own solution is anything but simple; it actually fills
the better part of this book. We submit that an avalanche of social
dislocation, surpassing by far that of the enclosure period came
down upon England; that this catastrophe was the accompaniment
of a vast movement of economic improvement; that an entirely new
institutional mechanism was starting to act on Western society;
that its dangers, which cut to the quick when they first appeared,
were never really overcome; and that the history of nineteenth
century civilization consisted largely in attempts to protect
society against the ravages of such a mechanism. The Industrial
Revolution was merely the beginning of a revolution as extremeand
radical as ever inflamed the minds of sectarians, but the new
creed was utterly materialistic and believed that all human problems
could be resolved - given an unlimited amount of material commodities.
(39, 40)</P>

<P>The story has been told innumerable times: how the expansion
of markets, the presence of coal and iron as well as a humid climate
favorable to the cotton industry, the multitude of people dispossessed
by the new eighteenth century enclosures, the existence of free
institutions, the invention of the machines, and other causes
interacted in ring about the Industrial Revolution. It has been
such a manner as to shown conclusively that no one single cause
deserves to be lifted out of the chain and set apart as thecause
of that sudden and unexpected event. (40)</P>

<P>But how shall this Revolution itself be defined? What was its
basic characteristic? Was it the rise of the factory towns, the
emergence of slums, the long working hours of children, the low
wages of certain categories of workers, the rise in the rate of
population increase, or the concentration of industries? We submit
that all these were merely incidental to one basic change, the
establishment of market economy, and that the nature of this institution
cannot be fully grasped unless the impact of the machine on a.
commercial society is realized. We do not intend to assert that
the machine caused that which happened, but we insist that once
elaborate machines and plant were used for production in a commercial
society, the idea of a self- regulating market was bound to take
shape. (40)</P>

<P>The use of specialized machines in an agrarian and commercial
society must produce typical effects. Such a society consists
of agriculturalists and of merchants who buy and sell the produce
of the land. Production with the help of specialized, elaborate,
expensive tools and plants can be fitted into such a society only
by making it incidental to buying and selling. The merchant is
the only person available for the undertaking of this, and he
is fitted to do so as long as this activity will not involve him
in a loss. He will sell the goods in the same manner in which
he would otherwise sell goods to those who demand them; but he
will procure them in a different way, namely, not by buying them
ready-made, but by purchasing the necessary labor and raw material.
The two put together according to the merchant's instructions,
plus some waiting which he might have to undertake, amount to
the new product. This is not a description of domestic industry
or &#147;putting out&#148; only, but of any kind of industrial
capitalism, including that of our own time. Important consequences
for the social system follow. (40, 41)</P>

<P>Since elaborate machines are expensive, they do not pay unless
large amounts of goods are produced. (Clapham, J. H., Economic
History of Modern Britain, Vol. III) They can be worked without
a loss only if the vent of the goods is reasonably assured and
if production need not be interrupted for want of the primary
goods necessary to feed the machines. For the merchant this means
that all factors involved must be on sale, that is, they must
be available in the needed quantities to anybody who is prepared
to pay for them. Unless this condition is fulfilled, production
with the help of specialized machines is too risky to be undertaken
both from the point of view of the merchant who stakes his money
and of the community as a whole which comes to depend upon continuous
production for incomes, employment, and provisions. (41)</P>

<P>Now, in an agricultural society such conditions would not naturally
be given; they would have to be created. That they would be created
gradually in no way affccts the startling nature of the changes
involved. The transformation implies a change in the motive of
action on the part of the members of society: for the motive of
subsistence that of gain must be- substituted. All transactions
are turned into money transactions, and these in turn require
that a medium of exchange be introduced into every articulation
of industrial life. All incomes must derive from the sale of something
or other, and whatever the actual source of a person's income,
it must be regarded as resulting from sale. No less is implied
in the simple term &quot;market system,&quot; by which we designate
the institutional pattern described. But the most startling peculiarity
of the system lies in the fact that, once it is established, it
must be allowed to function without outside interference. Profits
are not any more guaranteed, and the merchant must make his profits
on the market. Prices must be allowed to regulate themselves.
Such a self-regulating system of markets is what we mean by a
market economy. (41, 42)</P>

<P>The transformation to this system from the earlier economy
is so complete that it resembles more the metamorphosis of the
caterpillar than any alteration that can be expressed in terms
of continuous growth and development. Contrast, for example, the
merchant-producer's selling activities with his buying activities;
his sales concern only artifacts; whether he succeeds or not in
finding purchasers, the fabric of society need not be affected.
But what he buys is raw materials and labor - nature and man.
Machine production in a commercial society involves, in effect,
no less a transformation than that of the natural and human substance
of society into commodities. The conclusion, though weird, is
inevitable; nothing less will serve the purpose: obviously, the
dislocation caused by such devices must disjoint man's relationships
and threaten his natural habitat with annihilation. (42)</P>

<P>Such a danger was, in fact, imminent. We shall perceive its
true character if we examine the laws which govern the mechanism
of a self-regulating market. (42)
