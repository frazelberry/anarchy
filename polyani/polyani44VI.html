<P>Chapter VI, <I>THE SELF-REGULATING MARKET AND THE FICTITIOUS
COMMODITIES: LABOR, LAND, AND MONEY</I></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The cursory outline of the economic system and markets, taken
  separately, shows that never before our own time were markets
  more than accessories of economic life.  As a rule, the economic
  system was absorbed in the social system, and whatever principle
  of behavior prcdominated in the economy, the presence of the
  markt!t pattern was found to be compatible with it.  The principle
  of barter or exchange, which underlies this pattern, revealed
  no tendency to expand at the expense of the rest.  Where markets
  were most highly developed, as under the mercantile system, they
  throve under the control of a centralized administration which
  fostered autarchy both in the households of the peasantry and
  in respect to national life.  Regulation and markets, in effect,
  grew up together.  The self-regulating market was unknown; indeed
  the emergence of the idea of self-regulation was a cornplete
  reversal of the trend of development.  It is in the light of
  these facts that the extraordinary assumptions underlying<BR>
  a market economy can alone be fully comprehended. (68)</P>
  <P>A market economy is an economic system controlled, regulated,
  and directed by markets alone; order in the production and distribution
  of goods is entrusted to this self-regulating mechanism.  An
  economy of this kind derives from the expectation that human
  beings behave in such a way as to achieve maximum money gains.
   It assumes markets in which the supply of goods (including services)
  available at a definite price will equal the demand at that price.
   It assumes the presence of money, which functions as purchasing
  power in the hands of its owners.  Production will then be controlled
  by prices, for the profits of those who direct production will
  depend upon them; the distribution of the goods also will depend
  upon prices, for prices form incomes, and it is with the help
  of these incomes that the goods produced are distributed amongst
  the members of society.  Under these assumptions order in the
  production and distribution of goods is ensured by prices alone.
  (68)</P>
  <P>Self-regulation implies that all production is for sale on
  the market -and that all incomes derive from such sales.  Accordingly,
  there are markets for all elements of industry, not only for
  goods (always including services) but also for labor, land, and
  money, their prices being called respectively commodity prices,
  wages, rent, and interest.  The very terms indicate that prices
  form incomes: interest is the price for the use of money and
  forms the income of those who are in the position to provide
  it; rent is the price for the use of land and forms the income
  of those who supply it; wages are the price for the use of labor
  power, and form the income of those who sell it; commodity prices,
  finally, contribute to the incomes of those who sell their entrepreneurial
  services, the income called profit being actually the difference
  between two sets of prices, the price of the goods produced and
  their costs, i.e., the price of the goods necessary to produce
  them.  If these conditions are fulfilled, all incomes will derive
  from<BR>
  sales on the market, and incomes will be just sufficient to buy
  all the goods produced.</P>
  <P>A further group of assumptions follows in respect to the state
  and its policy.  Nothing must be allowed to inhibit the formation
  of markets, nor must incomes be permitted to be formed otherwise
  than through sales.  Neither must there be any interference with
  the adjustment of prices to changed market conditions-whether
  the prices are those of goods, labor, land, or money.  Hence
  there must not only be markets for all elements of industry (Henderson,
  H. D., Supply and Demand, 1922. The practice of the market is
  twofold: the apportionment of factors between different uses,
  and the organizing of the forces influencing aggregate supplies
  of factors), but no measure or policy must be countenanced that
  would influence the action of these markets.  Neither price,
  nor supply, nor demand must be fixed or regulated; only such
  policies and measures are in order which help to ensure the.self-regulation
  of the market by creating conditions which make the market the
  only organizing power in the economic sphere. (69)</P>
  <P>To realize fully what this means, let us return for a moment
  to the mercantile system and the national markets which it did
  so much to develop.  Under feudalism and the gild system land
  and labor formed part of the social organization itself (money
  had yet hardly developed into a major element of industry). 
  Land, the pivotal element in the feudal order, was the basis
  of the military, judicial, administrative, and political system;
  its status and function were determined by legal and customary
  rules.  Whether its possession was transferable or not, and if
  so, to whom and under what restrictions; what the rights of property
  entailed; to what uses some types of land might be put-all these
  questions were rerrkoved from the organization of buying and
  selling, and subjected to an entirely different set of institutional
  regulations.The same was true of the organization of labor. 
  Under the gild system, as under every other economic system in
  previous history, the motives and circumstances of productive
  activities were<BR>
  embedded in the general organization of society.  The relations
  of master, journeyman, and apprentice; the terms of the craft;
  the number of apprentices; the wages of the workers were all
  regulated by the custom and rule of the gild and the town.  What
  the mercantile system did was merely to unify these conditions
  either through statute as in England, or through the &quot;nationalization&quot;
  of the gilds as in France. As to land, its feudal status was
  abolished only in so far as it was linked with provincial privileges;
  for the rest, land remained extra commercium, in England as in
  France.  Up to the Xime of ' the Great Revolution of 1789, landed
  estate remained the source of social privilege in France, and
  even after that time in England Common Law on land was essentially
  medieval.  Mercantilism, with all its tendency towards commercialization,
  never attacked the safeguards which protected these two basic
  elements ot production-labor and land-from becoming the objects
  of commerce.  In England the &quot;nationalization' of labor
  legislation through the Statute of Artificers (1563) and the
  Poor Law (1601), removed labor from the danger zone, and the
  anti-enclosure policy of the Tudors and early Stuarts was one
  consistent protest against the principle of the gainful use of
  landed property. (70)</P>
  <P>That mercantilism, however emphatically it insisted on commercialization
  as a national policy, thought of markets in a way exactly contrary
  to market economy, is best shown by its vast extension of state
  intervention in industry.  On this point there was no difference
  between mercantilists and feudalists, between crowned planners
  and vested interests, between centralizing bureaucrats and conservative
  particularists.  They disagreed only on the methods of regulation:
  gilds, towns, and provinces appealed to the force of custom and
  tradition, while the new state authority favored statute and
  ordinance.  But they were all equally averse to the idea of commercializing
  labor and land-the precondition of market economy.  Craft gilds
  and feudal privileges were abolished in France only in 1790;
  in England the Statute of Artificers lwas repealed only in 1813-14,
  the Elizabethan Poor Law in 1834. Not before the last decade
  of the eighteenth century was, in either country, the establishment
  of a free labor market even discussed; and the idea of the self-regulation
  of economic life was utterly beyond the horizon of the age. 
  The mercantilist was concerned with the development of the resources
  of the country, including full employment, through trade and
  commerce; the traditional organization of land and labor he took
  for granted.  He was in this respect as far removed from modern
  concepts as he was in the realm of politics, where his belief
  in the absolute powers of an enlightened despot was tempered
  by no intimations of democracy.  And just as the transition to
  a democratic system and representative politics involved a complete
  reversal of the trend of the age, the change from regulated to
  self-regulating markets at the end of the eighteenth century
  represented a complete transformation in the structure<BR>
  of society.(70, 71) </P>
  <P>A self-regulating market demands nothing less than the institutional
  separation of society into an economic and political sphere.
   Such a dichotomy is, in effect, merely the restatement, from
  the point of view of society as a whole, of the existence of
  a self-regulating market.  It might be argued that the separateness
  of the two spheres obtains in every type of society at all times.
   Such an inference, however, would be based on a fallacy.  True,
  no society can exist without a system of some kind which ensures
  order in the production and distribution of goods.  But that
  does not imply the existence of separate economic institutions;
  normally, the economic order is merely a function of the social,
  in which it is contained.  Neither under tribal, nor feudal,
  nor mercantile conditions was there, as we have shown, a separate
  economic system in society.  Nineteenth century society, in which
  economic activity was isolated and imputed to a distinctive economic
  motive, was, indeed, a singular departure. (71)</P>
  <P>Such an institutional.pattem could not function unless society
  was somehow subordinated to its requirements.  A market economy
  can exist only in a market society.  We reached this conclusion
  on general grounds in our analysis of the market pattern.  We
  can now specify the reasons for this assertion.  A market economy
  must comprise all elements of industry, including labor, land,
  and money. (In a market economy the last also is an essential
  element of industrial life and its inclusion in the market mechanism
  has, as we will see, far-reaching institutional consequences.)
  But labor and land are no other than the human beings themselves
  of which every society consists and the natural surroundings
  in which it exists.  To include them in the market mechanism
  means to subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws
  of the market.(71)</P>
  <P>We are now in the position to develop in a more concrete form
  the institutional nature of a market economy, and the perils
  to society which it involves.  We will, first, describe the methods
  by which the market mechanism is enabled to control and direct
  the actual elements of 'industrial life; second, we will try
  to gauge the nature of the effects of such a mechanism on the
  society which is subjected to its action.(71, 72)</P>
  <P>It is with the help of the commodity concept that the mechanism
  of the market is geared to the various elements of industrial
  life.  Commodities are here empirically defined as objects produced
  for sale on the market; markets, again, are empirically defined
  as actual contacts between buyers and sellers.  Accordingly,
  every element of industry is regarded as having been produced
  for sale, as then and then only will it be subject to the supply-and-demand
  mechanism interacting with price.  In practice this means that
  there must be markets for every element of industry; that in
  these markets each of these elements is organized into a supply
  and a demand group; and that each element has a price which interacts
  with demand and supply.  These marketsand they are numberless
  - are interconnected and form One Big Market. (Hawtrey, G. R.,
  op. cit.  Its function is seen by Hawtrey in making &quot;the
  reiative market values of all commodities mutually consistent.)
  (71, 72)</P>
  <P>The crucial point is this: labor, land, and money are essential
  elements of industry; they also must be organized in markets;
  in fact, these markets form an absolutely vital part of the economic
  system.  But labor, land, and money are obviously not commodities;
  the postulate that anything that is bought and sold must have
  been produced for sale is emphatically untrue in regard to them.
   In other words, according to the empirical definition of a commodity
  they are not commodities.  Labor is only another name for a human
  activity which goes with life itself, which in its turn is not
  produced for sale but for entirely different reasons, nor can
  that activity be detached from the rest of life, be stored or
  mobilized; land is only another name for nature, which is not
  produced by man; actual money, finally, is merely a token of
  purchasing power which, as a rule, is not produced at all, but
  comes into being through the mechanism of banking or state finance.
   None of them is produced for sale.  The commodity description<BR>
  of labor, land, and money is entirely fictitious.Nevertheless,
  it is with the help of this fiction that the actual markets or
  labor, land, and money are organized; (Marx's assertion of the
  fetish character of the value of commodities refers to the exchange
  value of genuine commodities and has nothing in common with the
  fictitious commodities mentioned in the text) they are being
  actually bought and sold on the market;. their demand and supply
  are real magnitudes; and any measures or policies that would
  inhibit the formation of such markets would ipso facto endanger
  the self regulation of the system.  The commodity fiction, therefore,
  supplies a vital organizing principle in regard to the whole
  of society affecting almost all its institutions in the most
  varied way, namely, the principle according to which no arrangement
  or behavior should be allowed to exist that might prevent the
  actual functioning of the market mechanism on the lines of the
  commodity fiction. (72, 73)</P>
  <P>Now, in regard to labor, land, and money such a postulate
  cannot be upheld.  To allow the market mechanism to be sole director
  of the fate of human beings and their natural environment, indeed,
  even of the amount and use of purchasing power, would result
  in the demolition of society.  For the alleged commodity &quot;labor
  power&quot; cannot be shoved about, used indiscriminately, or
  even left unused, without affecting also the human individual
  who happens to be the bearer of this peculiar commodity.  In
  disposing of a man's labor power the system would, incidentally,
  dispose of the physical, psychological, and moral entity &quot;man&quot;
  attached to that tag.  Robbed of the protective covering of cultural
  institutions, human beings would perish from the effects of social
  exposure; they would die as the victims of acute social dislocation
  through vice, perversion, crime, and starvation.  Nature would
  be reduced to its elements, neighborhoods and landscapes defiled,
  rivers polluted, military safety jeopardized, the power to<BR>
  produce food and raw materials destroyed.  Finally, the market
  administration of purchasing power would periodically liquidate
  business enterprise, for shortages and surfeits of money would
  prove as disastrous to business as floods and droughts in primitive
  society.  Undoubtedly, labor, land, and money markets are essential
  to a market economy.  But no society could stand the effects
  of such a system of crude fictions even for the shortest stretch
  of time unless its human and natural substance as well as its
  business organization was protected against the ravages of this
  satanic mill.(73)</P>
  <P>The extreme artificiality of market economy is rooted in the
  fact that the process of production itself is here organized
  in the form of buying and selling.(Cunningham, W., &quot;Economic
  Change,&quot; Cambridge Modern History, Vol.  I)  No other way
  of organizing production for the market is possible in a commercial
  society.  During the late Middle Ages industrial production for
  export was organized by wealthy burgesses, and carried on under
  their direct supervision in the home town. Later, in the mercantile
  society, production was organized by merchants and was not restricted
  any more to the towns; this was the age of &#147;putting out&quot;
  when domestic industry was provided with raw materials by the
  merchant capitalist, who controlled the process of production
  as a purely commercial enterprise.  It was then that industrial
  production was definitely and on a large scale put under the
  organizing leadership of the merchant.  He knew the market, the
  volume as well as the quality of the demand; and he could vouch
  also for the<BR>
  supplies which, incidentally, consisted merely of wool, woad,
  and, sometimes, the looms or the knitting frames used by the
  cottage industry.  If supplies failed it was the cottager who
  was worst hit, for his employment was gone for the time; but
  no expensive plant was involved and the merchant incurred no
  serious risk in shouldering the responsibility for production.
   For centuries this system grew in power and scope until in a
  country like England the wool industry the national staple, covered
  large sectors of the country where production was organized by
  the clothier.  He who bought and sold, incidentally, provided
  for production-no separate motive was required.  The creation
  of goods involved neither the reciprocating attitudes of mutual
  aid; nor the concern of the householder for those whose needs
  are left to his care; nor the craftsman's pride in the exercise
  of his trade; nor the satisfaction of public praise-nothing but
  the plain motive of gain so familiar to the man whose profession
  is buying and selling.  Up<BR>
  to the end of the eighteenth century, industrial production in
  Western Europe was a mere accessory to commerce.(73, 74)</P>
  <P>As long as the machine was an inexpensive and unspecific tool
  there was no change in this position.  The mere fact that the
  cottager could produce larger amounts than before within the
  same time might induce him to use machines to increase earnings,
  but this fact, in itself, did not necessarily affect the organization
  of production.  Whether the cheap machinery was owned by the
  worker or by the merchant made some difference in the social
  position of the parties and almost certainly made a difference
  in the earnings of the worker, who was better off as long as
  he owned his tools; but it did not force the merchant to become
  an industrial capitalist, or to restrict himself to lending his
  money to such persons as were.  The vent of goods rarely gave
  out; the greater difficulty continued to be on the side of supply
  of raw materials, which was sometimes unavoidably interrupted.
   But, even in such cases, the loss to the merchant who owned
  the machines was not substantial.  It was not the coming of the
  machine as such but the invention Of elaborate and therefore
  specific machinery and plant which completely changed the relationship
  of the merchant to production. Although the new productive organization
  was introduced by the merchants - a fact which determined the
  whole course of the transformation - the use of elaborate machinery
  and plant involved the development of the factory system and
  therewith a decisive shift in the relative importance of commerce
  and industry in favor of the latter.  Industrial production ceased
  to be an accessory of commerce organized by the merchant as a
  buying and selling proposition; it now involved long-term investment
  with corresponding risks.  Unless the continuance of production
  was reasonably assured, such a risk was not bearable. (74, 75)</P>
  <P>But the more complicated industrial production became, the
  more numerous were the elements of industry the supply of which
  had to be safeguarded.  Three of these, of course, were of outstanding
  importance: labor, land, and money.  In a commercial society
  their supply could be organized in one way only: by being made
  available for purchase.  Hence, they would have to be organized
  for sale on the market -  in other words, as commodities.  The
  extension of the market mechanism to the elements of industry
  - labor, land, and money was the inevitable consequence of the
  introduction of the factory system in a commercial society. 
  The elements of industry had to be on sale.This was synonymous
  with the demand for a market system.  We know that profits are
  ensured under such a system only if self-regulation is safeguarded
  through interdependent competitive markets.  As the development
  of the, factory system had been organized as part of a process
  of buying and selling, therefore labor, land, and money had to
  be transformed into commodities in order to keep production going.
   They could, of course, not be really transformed into commodities,
  as actually they were not produced for sale on the market.  But
  the fiction of their being so produced became the organizing
  principle of society.  Of the three, one stands out: labor is
  the technical term used for human beings, in so far as they are
  not employers but employed; it follows that henceforth the organization
  of labor would change concurrently with the organization of the
  market system.  But as the organization of labor is only another
  word for the forms of life of the common people, this means that
  the development of the market system would be accompanied by
  a change in the organization of society itself.  All along the
  line, human society had become an accessory of the economic system.
  (75)</P>
  <P>We recall our parallel between the ravages of the enclosures
  in English history and the social catastrophe which followed
  the Industrial Revolution.  Improvements, we said, are, as a
  rule, bought at the price of social dislocation.  If the rate
  of dislocation is too great, the community must succumb in the
  process.  The Tudors and early Stuarts saved England from the
  fate of Spain by regulating the course of change so that it became
  bearable and its effects could be canalized into less destructive
  avenues.  But nothing saved the common people of England from
  the impact of the Industrial Revolution.  A blind faith in spontaneous
  progress had taken hold of people's minds, and with the fanaticism
  of sectarians the most enlightened pressed forward for boundless
  and unregulated change in society.  The effects on the lives
  of the people were awful beyond description.  Indeed, human society
  would have been annihilated but for protective countermoves which
  blunted the action of this self-destructive mechanism. Social
  history in the nineteenth century was thus the result of a double
  movement: the extension of the market organization in respect
  to genuine commodities was accompanied by its restriction in
  respect to fictitious ones.  While on the one hand markets spread
  all over the face of the globe and the amount of goods involved
  grew to and the unbelievable proportions, on the other hand a
  network of measures and policies was integrated into powerful
  institutions designed to check the action of the market relative
  to labor, land, and money.  While the organization of world commodity
  markets, world capital markets, and world currency markets under
  the aegis of the gold standard gave an unparalleled momentum
  to the mechanism of markets, a deep-seated movement sprang into
  being to resist the pernicious effects of a market-controlled
  economy. Society protected itself alainst the perils inherent
  in a self-regulating market system - this was the one comprehensive
  feature in the history of the age. (75, 76)<BR>
