<P>NINETEENTH CENTURY civilization was not destroyed by the external
or internal attack of barbarians; its vitality was not sapped
by the devastations of World War I nor by the revolt of a socialist
proletariat or a fascist lower middle class. Its failure was not
the outcome of some alleged laws of economics such as that of
the falling rate of profit or of under- consumption or overproduction.
It disintegrated as the result of an entirely different set of
causes: the measures which society adopted in order not to be
in its turn, annihilated by the action of the self-regulating
market. Apart from exceptional, circumstances such as existed
in North America in the age of the open frontier, the conflict
between the market and the elementary requirements of an organized
social life provided the century with its dynamics and produced
the typical strains and stresses which ultimately destroyed that
society. External wars merely hastened its destruction. (249)
After a century of blind &quot;improvement&quot; man is restoring
his &quot;habitation.&quot; If industrialism is not to extinguish
the race, it must be subordinated to the requirements of man's
nature. The true criticism of market society is not that it was
based on economics - a sense, every and any society must be based
on it - but that its economy was based on self-interest. Such
an organization of economic life is entirely unnatural, in the
strictly empirical sense of exceptional. Nineteenth century thinkers
assumed that in his economic activity man strove for profit, that
his materialistic propensities would induce him to choose the
lesser instead of the greater effort and to expect payment for
his labor; in short, that in his economic activity he would tend
to abide by what they described as economic rationality, and that
all contrary behavior was the result of outside interference.
It followed that markets were natural institutions, that they
would spontaneously arise if only men were let alone. Thus, nothing
could be more normal than an economic system consisting of markets
and under the sole control of market prices, and a human society
based on such markets appeared, therefore, as the goal of all
progress. Whatever the desirability or undesirability of such
a society on moral grounds, its practicability - this was axiomatic
- was grounded in the immutable characteristics of the race. (249,
250) Actually, as we now know, the behavior of man both in his
primitive state and right through the course of history has been
almost the opposite from that implied in this view. Frank H. Knight's
&quot;no specifically human motive is economic&quot; applies not
only to social life in general, but even to economic life itself.
The tendency to barter, on which Adam Smith so confidently relied
for his picture of primitive man, is not a common tendency of
the human being in his economic activities, but a most infrequent
one. Not only does the evidence of modern anthropology give the
lie to these rationalistic constructs, but the history of trade
and markets also has been completely different from that assumed
in the harmonistic teachings of nineteenth century sociologists.
Economic history reveals that the emergence of national markets
was in no way the result of the gradual and spontaneous emancipation
of the economic sphere from governmental control. On the contrary,
the market has been the outcome of a conscious and often violent
intervention on the part of government which imposed the market
organization on society for noneconomic ends. And the self-regulating
market of the nineteenth century turns out on closer inspection
to be radically different from even its immediate predecessor
in that it relied for its regulation on economic self-interest.
The congenital weakness of nineteenth century society was not
that it was industrial but that it was a market society. Industrial
civilization will continue to exist when the utopian experiment
of a self-regulating market will be no more than a memory. (250)
Yet the shifting of industrial civilization onto a new nonmarketing
basis seems to many a task too desperate to contemplate. They
fear an institutional vacuum or, even worse, the loss of freedom.
Need these perils prevail? (250) Much of the massive suffering
inseparable from a period of transition is already behind us.
In the social and economic dislocation of our age, in the tragic
vicissitudes of the depression, fluctuations of currency, mass
unemployment, shiftings of social status, spectacular destruction
of historical states, we have experienced the worst. Unwittingly
we have been paying the price of the change. Far as mankind still
is from having adapted itself to the use of machines, and great
as the pending changes are, the restoration of the past is as
impossible as the transfering of our troubles to another planet.
Instead of eliminating the demonic forces of aggression and conquest,
such a futile attempt would actually ensure the survival of those
forces, even after their utter military defeat. The cause of evil
would become endowed with the advantage, decisive in politics,
of representing the possible, in opposition to that which is impossible
of achievement however good it may be of intention. (250, 251)
Nor does the collapse of the traditional system leave us in the
void. Not for the first time in history may makeshifts contain
the germs of great and permanent institutions. (251) Within the
nations we are witnessing a development under which the economic
system ceases to lay down the law to society and the primacy of
society over that system is secured. This may happen in a great
variety of ways, democratic and aristocratic, constitutionalist
and authoritarian, perhaps even in a fashion yet utterly unforeseen.
The future in some countries may be already the present in others,
while some may still embody the past of the rest. But the outcome
is common with them all: the market system will no longer be self-regulating,
even in principle, since it will not comprise labor, land, and
money. (251) To take labor out of the market means a transformation
as radical as was the establishment of a competitive labor market.
The wage contract ceases to be a private contract except on subordinate
and accessory points. Not only conditions in the factory, hours
of work, and modalities of contract, but the basic wage itself,
are determined outside the market; what role accrues thereby to
trade unions, state, and other public bodies depends not only
on the character of these institutions but also on the actual
organization of the management of production. Though in the nature
of things wage differentials must (and should) continue to play
an essential part in the economic system, other motives than those
directly involved in money incomes may outweigh by far the financial
aspect of labor. (251) To remove land from the market is synonymous
with the incorporation of land with definite institutions such
as the homestead, the cooperative, the factory, the township,
the school, the church, parks, wild life preserves, and so on.
However widespread individual ownership of farms will continue
to be, contracts in respect to land tenure need deal with accessories
only, since the essentials are removed from the jurisdiction of
the market. The same applies to staple foods and organic raw materials,
since the fixing of prices in respect to them is not left to the
market. That for an infinite variety of products competitive markets
continue to function need not interfere with the constitution
of society any more than the fixing of prices outside the market
for labor, land, and money interferes with the costing-function
of prices in respect to the various products. The nature of property,
of course, undergoes a deep change in consequence of such measures
since there is no longer any need to allow incomes from the title
of property to grow without bounds, merely in order to ensure
employment, production, and the use of resources in society. (251,
252) The removal of the control of money from the market is being
accomplished in all countries in our day. Unconsciously, the creation
of deposits effected this to a large extent, but the crisis of
the gold standard in the twenties proved that the link between
commodity money and token money had by no means been severed.
Since the introduction of &quot;functional finance&quot; in all
important states, the directing of investments and the regulation
of the rate of saving have become government tasks. (252) To remove
the elements of production - land, labor, and money - from the
market is thus a uniform act only from the viewpoint of the market,
which was dealing with them as if they were commodities. From
the viewpoint of human reality that which is restored by the disestablishment
of the commodity fiction lies in all directions of the social
compass. In effect, the disintegration of a uniform market economy
is already giving rise to a variety of new societies. Also, the
end of market society means in no way the absence of markets.
These continue, in various fashions, to ensure the freedom of
the consumer, to indicate the shifting of demand, to influence
producers' income, and to serve as an instrument of accountancy,
while ceasing altogether to be an organ of economic self-regulation.
(252) In its international methods, as in these internal methods,
nineteenth century society was constricted by economics. The realm
of fixed foreign exchanges was coincident with civilization. As
long as the gold standard and - what became almost its corollary
- constitutional regimes were in operation, the balance of power
was a vehicle of peace. The system worked through the instrumentality
of those Great Powers, first and foremost Great Britain, who were
the center of world finance, and pressed for the establishment
of representative government in less advanced countries. This
was required as a check on the finances and currencies of debtor
countries with the consequent need for controlled budgets, such
as only responsible bodies can provide. Though, as a rule, such
considerations were not consciously present in the minds of statesmen,
this was the case only because the requirements of the gold standard
ranked as axiomatic. The uniform world pattern of monetary and
representative institutions was the result of the rigid economy
of the period. (252, 253) Two principles of nineteenth century
international life derived their relevance from this situation:
anarchistic sovereignty and &quot;justified&quot; intervention
in the affairs of other countries. Though apparently contradictory,
the two were interrelated. Sovereignty, of course, was a purely
political term, for under unregulated foreign trade and the gold
standard governments possessed no powers in respect to international
economics. They neither could nor would bind their countries in
respect to monetary matters - this was the legal position. Actually,
only countries which possessed a monetary system controlled by
central banks were reckoned sovereign states. With the powerful
Western countries this unlimited and unrestricted national monetary
sovereignty was combined with its complete opposite, an unrelenting
pressure to spread the fabric of market economy and market society
elsewhere. Consequently, by the end of the nineteenth century
the peoples of the world were institutionally standardized to
a degree unknown before. (253) This system was hampering both
on account of its elaborateness and its universality. Anarchistic
sovereignty was a hindrance to all effective forms of international
co-operation, as the history of the League of Nations strikingly
proved; and enforced uniformity of domestic systems hovered as
a permanent threat over the freedom of national development, especially
in backward countries and sometimes even in advanced, but financially
weak countries. Economic co-operation was limited to private institutions
as rambling and ineffective as free trade, while actual collaboration
between peoples, that is, between governments, could never even
be envisaged. (253) The situation may well make two apparently
incompatible demands on foreign policy: it will require closer
co-operation between friendly countries than could even be contemplated
under nineteenth century sovereignty, while at the same time the
existence of regulated markets will make national governments
more jealous of outside interference than ever before. However,
with the disappearance of the automatic mechanism of the gold
standard, governments will find it possible to drop the most obstructive
feature of absolute sovereignty, the refusal to collaborate in
international economics. At the same time it will become possible
to tolerate willingly that other nations shape their domestic
institutions according to their inclinations, thus transcending
the pernicious nineteenth century dogma of the necessary uniformity
of domestic regimes within the orbit of world economy. Out of
the ruins of the Old World, cornerstones of the New can be seen
to emerge: economic collaboration of governments and the liberty
to orgarnze national life at will. Under the constrictive system
of free trade neither of these possibilities could have been conceived
of, thus excluding a variety of methods of co-operation between
nations. While under market economy and the gold standard the
idea of federation was justly deemed a nightmare of centralization
and uniformity, the end of market economy may well mean effective
co-operation with domestic freedom. (253, 254)</P>

<P>The problem of freedom arises on two different levels: the
institutional and the moral or religious. On the institutional
level it is a matter of balancing increased against diminished
freedoms; no radically new questions are encountered. On the more
fundamental level the very possibility of freedom. is in doubt.
It appears that the means of maintaining freedom are themselves
adulterating and destroying it. The key to the problem of freedom
in our age must be sought on this latter plane. Institutions are
embodiments of human meaning and purpose. We cannot achieve the
freedom we seek, unless we comprehend the true significance of
freedom in a complex society. (254) On the institutional level,
regulation both extends and restricts freedom; only the balance
of the freedoms lost and won is significant. This is true of juridical
and actual freedoms alike. The comfortable classes enjoy the freedom
provided by leisure in security; they are naturally less anxious
to extend freedom in society than those who for lack of income
must rest content with a minimum of it. This becomes apparent
as soon as compulsion is suggested in order to more justly spread
out income, leisure and security. Though restriction applies to
all, the privileged tend to resent it, as if it were directed
solely against themselves. They talk of slavery, while in effect
only an extension to the others of the vested freedom they themselves
enjoy is intended. Initially, there may have to be reduction in
their own leisure and security, and, consequently, their freedom
so that the level of freedom throughout the land shall be raised.
But such a shifting, reshaping and enlarging of freedoms should
offer no ground whatsoever for the assertion that the new condition
must necessarily be less free than was the old. (254) Yet there
are freedoms the maintenance of which, is of paramount importance.
They were, like peace a by-product of nineteenth-century economy,
and we have come to cherish them for their own sake. The institutional
separation of politics and economics, which proved a deadly danger
to the substance of society, almost automatically produced freedom
at the cost of justice and security. Civic liberties, private
enterprise and wage-system fused into a pattern of life which
favored moral freedom and independence of mind. Here again, juridical
and actual freedoms merged into a common fund, the elements of
which cannot be neatly separated. Some were the corollary of evils
like unemployment and speculator's profits; some belonged to the
most precious traditions of Renaissance and Reformation. We must
try to maintain by all means in our power these high values inherited
from the market economy which collapsed. This, assuredly, is a
great task. Neither freedom nor peace could be institutionalized
under that economy, since its purpose was to create profits and
welfare, not peace and freedom. We will have consciously to strive
for them in the future if we are to possess them at all; they
must become chosen aims of the societies towards which we are
moving. This may well be the true purport of the present world
effort to make peace and freedom secure. How far the will to peace
can assert itself once the interest in peace which sprang from
.nineteenth-century economy has ceased to !operate will depend
upon our success in establishing an international order. As to
personal liberty, it will exist to the degree in which we will
deliberately create new safeguards for its maintenance and, indeed,
extension. In an established society, the right to nonconformity
must be institutionally protected. The individual must be free
to follow his conscience without fear of the powers that happen
to be entrusted with administrative tasks in some of the fields
of social life. Science and the arts should always be under the
guardianship of the republic of letters. Compulsion should never
be absolute; the &quot;objector&quot; should be offered a niche
to which he can retire, the choice of a &quot;second-best&quot;
that leaves him a life to live. Thus will be secured the right
to nonconformity as the hallmark of a free society. (254, 255)
Every move towards integration in society should thus be accompanied
by an increase of freedom; moves towards planning should comprise
the strengthening of the rights of the individual in society.
His indefeasible rights must be enforceable under the law even
against the supreme powers, whether they be personal or anonymous.
The true answer to the threat of bureaucracy as a source of abuse
of power is to create spheres of arbitrary freedom protected by
unbreakable rules. For, however generously devolution of power
is practised, there will be strengthening of power at the center,
and, therefore, danger to individual freedom. This is true even
in respect to the organs of democratic communities themselves,
as well as the professional and trade unions whose function it
is to protect the rights of each individual member. Their very
size might make him feel helpless, even though he had no reason
to suspect ill-will on their part. The more so, if his views or
actions were such as to offend the susceptibilities of those who
wield power. No mere declaration of rights can suffice: institutions
are required to make the rights effective. Habeas corpus need
not be the last constitutional device by which personal freedom
was anchored in law. Rights of the citizen hitherto unacknowledged
must be added to the Bill of Rights. They must be made to prevail
against all authorities, whether State, municipal or professional.
The list should be headed by the right of the individual to a
job under approved conditions, irrespective of his or her political
or religious views, or of color and race. This implies guarantees
against victimization however subtle it be. Industrial tribunals
have been known to protect the individual member of the public
even from such agglomerations of arbitrary power as were represented
by the early railway companies. Another instance of possible abuse
of power squarely met by tribunals was the 'Essential Works Order
in England, or the &quot;freezing of labor&quot; in the United
States, during the emergency, with their almost unlimited opportunities
for discrimination. Wherever public opinion was solid in upholding
civic liberties, tribunals or courts have always been found capable
of vindicating personal freedom. It should be upheld at all cost-even
that of efficiency in production, economy in consumption or rationality
in administration. An industrial society can afford to be free.
(255, 256) The passing of market-economy can become the beginning
of an era of unprecedented freedom. juridical and, actual freedom
can be made wider and more general than ever before; regulation
and control can achieve freedom not only for the few, but for
all. Freedom not as an appurtenance of privilege, tainted at the
source, but as a prescriptive right extending far beyond the narrow
confines of the political sphere into the intimate organization
of society itself. Thus will old freedoms and civic rights be
added to the fund of new freedom generated by the leisure and
security that industrial society offers to all. Such a society
can afford to be both just and free. (256) Yet we find the path
blocked by a moral obstacle. Planning and control are being attacked
as a denial of freedom. Free enterprise and private ownership
are declared to be essentials of freedom. No society built on
other foundations is said to deserve to be called free. The freedom
that regulation creates is denounced as unfreedom; the justice,
liberty and welfare it offers are decried as a camouflage of slavery.
In vain did socialists promise a realm of freedom, for means determine
ends: the U.S.S.R., which used planning, regulation and control
as its instruments, has not yet put the liberties promised in
her Constitution into practice, and, probably, the critics add,
never will. But to turn against regulation means to turn against
reform. With the liberal the idea of freedom thus degenerates
into a mere advocacy of free enterprise - which is today reduced
to a fiction by the hard reality of giant trusts and princely
monopolies. This means the fullness of freedom for those whose
income, leisure and security need no enhancing, and a mere pittance
of liberty for the people, who may in vain attempt to make use
of their democratic rights to gain shelter from the power of the
owners of property. Nor is that all. Nowhere did the liberals
in fact succeed in re-establishing free enterprise, which was
doomed to fail for intrinsic reasons. It was as a result of their
efforts that big business was installed in several European countries
and, incidentally, also various brands of fascism, as in Austria.
Planning, regulation and control, which they wanted to see banned
as dangers to freedom, were then employed by the confessed enemies
of freedom to abolish it altogether. Yet the victory of fascism
was made practically unavoidable by the liberals' obstruction
of any reform involving planning, regulation, or control. (256,
257) Freedom's utter frustration in fascism is, indeed, the inevitable
result of the liberal philosophy, which claims that power and
compulsion are evil, that freedom demands their absence from a
human community. No such thing is possible; in a complex society
this becomes apparent. This leaves no altemative but either to
remain faithful to an illusionary idea of freedom and deny the
reality of society, or to accept that reality and reject the idea
of freedom. The first is the liberal's conclusion; the latter
the fascist's. No other seems possible. (258) Inescapably we reach
the conclusion that the very possibility of freedom is in question.,
If regulation is the only means of spreading and strengthening
freedom in a complex society, and yet to make use of this means
is contrary to freedom per se, then such a society cannot be free.
(258) Clearly, at the root of the dilemma there is the meaning
of freedom itself. Liberal economy gave a false direction to our
ideals. It seemed to approximate the fulfilment of intrinsically
utopian expectations. No society is possible in which power and
compulsion are absent, nor a world in which force has no function.
It was an illusion to assume a society shaped by man's will and
wish alone. Yet this was the result of a market-view of society
which equated economics with contractual relationships, and contractual
relations with freedom. The radical illusion was fostered that
there is nothing in human society that is not derived from the
volition of individuals and that could not, therefore, be removed
again by their volition. Vision was limited by the market which
&quot;fragmentated&quot; life into the producers' sector that
ended when his product reached the market, and the sector of the
consumer for whom all goods sprang from the market. The one derived
his income &quot;freely&quot; from the market, the other spent
it &quot;freely&quot; there. Society as a whole remained invisible.
The power of the State was of no account, since the less its power,
the smoother the market mechanism would function. Neither voters,
nor owners, neither producers, nor consumers could be held responsible
for such brutal restrictions of freedom as were involved in the
occurrence of unemployment and destitution. Any decent individual
could imagine himself free from all responsibility for acts of
compulsion on the part of a State which he, personally, rejected;
or for economic suffering in society from which he, personally,
had not benefited. He was &quot;paying his way,&quot; was &quot;in
nobody's debt,&quot; and was unentangled in the evil of power
and economic value. His lack of responsibility for them seemed
so evident that he denied their reality in the name of his freedom.
(258) But power and economic value are a paradigm of social reality.
They do not spring from human volition; noncooperation is impossibie
in regard to them. The function of power is to ensure that measure
of conformity which is needed for the survival of the group; its
ultimate source is opinion - and who could help holding opinions
of some sort or other? Economic value ensures the usefulness of
the goods produced; it must exist prior to the decision to produce
them; it is a seal set on the division of labor. Its source is
human wants and scarcity - and how could we be expected not to
desire one thing more than another? Any opinion or desire will
make us participants in the creation of power and in the constituting
of economic value. No freedom to do otherwise is conceivable.
(258) We have reached the final stage of our argument. (258) 'The
discarding of the market utopia brings us face to face with the
reality of society. It is the dividing line between liberalism
on the one hand, fascism and socialism on the other. The difference
between these two is not primarily economic. It is moral and religious.
Even where they profess identical economics, they are not only
different but are, indeed, embodiments of opposite principles.
And the ultimate on which they separate is again freedom. By fascists
and socialists alike the reality of society is accepted with the
finality with which the knowledge of death has molded human consciousness.
Power and compulsion are a part of that reality; an ideal that
would ban them from society must be invalid. The issue on which
they divide is whether in the light of this knowledge the idea
of freedom can be upheld or not; is freedom an empty word, a temptation,
designed to ruin man and his works, or can man reassert his freedom
in the face of that knowledge and strive for its fulfillment in
society without lapsing into moral illusionism? (257, 258A) This
anxious question sums up the condition of man. The spirit and
content of this study should indicate an answer. (258A)</P>

<P>We invoked what we believed to be the three constitutive facts
in the consciousness of Western man: knowledge of death, knowledge
of freedom, knowledge of society. The first, according to Jewish
legend, was revealed in the Old Testament story. The second was
revealed through the discovery of the uniqueness of the person
in the teachings of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament. The
third revelation came to us through living in an industrial society.
No one great name attaches to it; perhaps Robert Owen came nearest
to becoming its vehicle. It is the constitutive element in modern
man's consciousness. (258A) The fascist answer to the recognition
of the reality of society is the rejection of the postulate of
freedom. The Christian discovery of the uniqueness of the individual
and of the oneness of mankind is negated by fascism. Here lies
the root of its degenerative bent. (258A) Robert Owen was the
first to recognize that the Gospels ignored the reality of society.
He called this the &quot;individualization&quot; of man on the
part of Christianity and appeared to believe that only in a co-operative
commonwealth could &quot;all that is truly valuable in Christianity&quot;
cease to be separated from man. Owen recognized that the freedom
we gained through the teachings of Jesus was inapplicable to a
complex society. His socialism was the upholding of man's claim
to freedom in such a society. The post-Christian era of Western
civilization had begun, in which the Gospels did not any more
suffice, and yet remained the basis of our civilization. (258A)
The discovery of society is thus either the end or the rebirth
of freedom. While the fascist resigns himself to relinquishing
freedom and glorifies power which is the reality of society, the
socialist resigns himself to that reality and upholds the claim
to freedom, in spite of it. Man becomes mature and able to exist
as a human being in a complex society. To quote once more Robert
Owen's inspired words: &quot;Should any causes of evil be irremovable
by the new powers which men are about to acquire, they will know
that they are necessary and unavoidable evils; and childish, unavailing
complaints will cease to be made.&quot; (258A, 258B) Resignation
was ever the fount of man's strength and new hope., Man accepted
the reality of death and built the meaning of his bodily life
upon it. He resigned himself to the truth that he had a soul to
lose and that there was worse than death, and founded his freedom
upon it. He resigns himself, in our time, to the reality of society
which means the end of that freedom. But, again, life springs
from ultimate resignation. Uncomplaining acceptance of the reality
of society gives man indomitable courage and strength to remove
all removable injustice and unfreedom. As long as he is true to
his task of creating more abundant freedom for all, he need not
fear that either power or planning will turn against him and destroy
the freedom he is building by their instrumentality. This is the
meaning of freedom in a complex society; it gives us all the certainty
that we need. (258B)
