<P><!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION-->&nbsp;</P>

<P>EVEN CAPITALIST business itself had to be sheltered from the
unrestricted working of the market mechanism. This should dispose
of the suspicion which the very terms man&quot; and &quot;nature&quot;
awaken in sophisticated minds, who tend to denounce all talk about
protecting labor and land as the product of antiquated ideas if
not as a mere camouflaging of vested interests. (192)</P>

<P>Actually, in the case of productive enterprise as in that of
man and nature the peril was real and objective. The need for
protect on account of the manner in which the supply of money
was under a market system. Modern central banking, in effect,
was essentially a devise developed for the purpose of offering
protection without which the market would have destroyed its own
children, the business enterprises of all kinds. Eventually, however,
it was this form of protection which contributed most immediately
to the downfall of the international system. (192)</P>

<P>While the perils threatening land and labor from the market
are fairly obvious, the dangers to business inherent in the monetary
system are not as readily apprehended. Yet if profits depend upon
prices, then the monetary arrangements - upon which prices depend,
must be vital to the functioning of any system motivated by profits.
While, in the long run, changes in selling prices need not affect
profits, since costs will move up and down correspondingly, this
is not true in the short run, since there must be a time-lag before
contractually fixed prices change. Among them is the price of
labor which, together with many other prices, would naturally
be fixed by contract. Hence, if the price level was falling for
monetary reasons over a considerable time, business would be in
danger of liquidation accompanied by the dissolution of productive
organization and massive destruction of capital. Not low prices,
but falling prices were the trouble. Hume became the founder of
the quantity theory of money with his discovery that business
remains unaffected if the amount of money is halved since prices
will simply adjtist to half their former level. He forgot that
business might be destroyed in the process. (192, 193)</P>

<P>This is the easily understandable reason why a system of commodity
money, such as the market mechanism tends to produce without outside
interference, is incompatible with industrial production. Cornmodity
money is simply a commodity which happens to function as money,
and its amount, therefore cannot, in principle, be increased except
by diminishing the amount of the commodities not functioning as
money. In practice commodity money is usually gold or silver,
the amount of which can be increased, but not by much, within
a short time. But the expansion of production and trade unaccom&not;
panied by an increase in the amount of money must cause a fall
in the price level - precisely the type of ruinous deflation which
we have in mind. Scarcity of money was a permanent, grave complaint
with seventeenth century merchant communities. Token money was
developed at an early date to shelter trade from the enforced
deflations that accompanied the use of specie when the volume
of business swelled. No market economy was possible without the
medium of such artificial money. (193)</P>

<P>The real difficulty arose with the need for stable foreign
exchanges and the consequent introduction of the gold standard,
about the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Stable exchanges became
essential to the very existence of English economy; London had
become the financial center of a growing world trade. Yet nothing
else but commodity money could serve this end for the obvious
reason that token money, whether bank or fiat, cannot circulate
on foreign soil. Hence, the gold standard - the accepted name
for a system of international commodity money - came to the fore.
(193)</P>

<P>But for domestic purposes, as we know, specie is an inadequate
money just because it is a commodity and its amount cannot be
increased at will. The amount of gold available may be increased
by a few per cent over a year, but not by as many dozen within
a few weeks, as might be required to carry a suddenexpansion of
transactions. In the absence of token money business would have
to be either curtailed or carried on at very much lower prices,
thus inducing a slump and creating unemployment. (193)</P>

<P>In its simplest form the problem was this: commodity money
was vital to the existence of foreign trade; token money, to the
existence of domestic trade. How far did they agree with each
other? (193)</P>

<P>Under nineteenth century conditions foreign trade and the gold
standard had undisputed priority over the needs of domestic business.
The working of the gold standard required the lowering of domestic
prices whenever the exchange was threatened by depreciation. Since
deflation happens through credit restrictions, it follows that
the working of commodity money interfered with the working of
the credit system. This was a standing danger to business. Yet,
to discard token money altogether and restrict currency to commodity
money was entirely out of the question, since such a remedy would
have been worse than the disease. (193, 194)</P>

<P>Central banking mitigated this defect of credit money greatly.
By centralizing the supply of credit in a country, it was possible
to avoid the wholesale dislocation of business and employment
involved in deflation and to organize deflation in such a way
as to absorb the shock and spread its burden over the whole country.
The bank in its normal function was cushioning the immediate effects
of gold withdrawals on the circulation of notes as well as of
the diminished circulation of notes on business. (194)</P>

<P>The bank might use various methods. Short-term loans might
bridge the gap caused by short-run losses of gold, and avoid the
need for credit restrictions altogether. But even when restrictions
of credit were inevitable, as was often the case, the bank's action
had a buffer effect: The raising of the bank rate as well as open-market
operations spread the effects of restrictions to the whole community
while shifting the burden of the restrictions to the strongest
shoulders. (194)</P>

<P>Let us envisage the crucial case of transferring one-sided
payments from one country to another, such as might be caused
by a shift in demand from domestic to foreign types of food. The
gold that now has to be sent abroad in payment for the imported
food would otherwise be used for inland payments, and its absence
must cause a falling off of domestic sales and a consequent drop
in prices. We will call this type of deflation &quot;transactional,&quot;
since it spreads from individual firm to firm according to their
fortuitous business dealings. Eventually, the spread of deflation
will reach the exporting firms and thus achieve the export surplus
which represents &quot;real&quot; transfer. But the harm and damage
caused to the community at large will be much greater than that
which was strictly necessary to achieve such an export surplus.
For there are always firms just short of being able to export,
which need only the inducement of a slight reduction of costs
to &quot;go over the top,&quot; and such a reduction can be most
economically achieved by spreading the deflation thinly over the
whole of the business community. (194)</P>

<P>This precisely was one of the functions of the central bank.
The broad pressure of its discount and open-market policy forced
domestic prices down more or less equally, and enabled &quot;export-near&quot;
firms to resume or increase exports, while only the least efficient
firms would have to liquidate. &quot;Real&quot; transfer would
thus have been achieved at the cost of a much smaller amount of
dislocation than would have been needed to attain the same export
surplus by the national method of haphazard and often catastrophic
shocks transmitted through the narrow channels of &quot;transactional
deflation.&quot; That in spite of these devices to mitigate the
effects of deflation, the outcome was, nevertheless, again and
again a complete disorganization of business and consequent mass
unemployment, is the most powerful of all the indictments of the
gold standard. (195)</P>

<P>The case of money showed a very real'analogy to that of labor
and land. The application of the commodity fiction to each of
them led to its effective inclusion into the market system, while
at the same time grave dangers to society developed. With money,
the threat was to productive enterprise, the existence of which
was imperiled by any fall in the price level caused by use of
commodity money. Here also protective measures had to be taken,
with the result that the self-steering mechanism of the market
was put out of action. (195)</P>

<P>Central banking reduced the automatism of the gold standard
to a in mere pretense. It meant a centrally managed currency;
manipulation was substituted for the self-regulating mechanism
of supplying credit, even though the device was not always deliberate
and conscious. More and more it was recognized that the international
gold standard could be made self-regulating only if the single
countries relinquished central banking. The one consistent adherent
of the pure gold standard who actually advocated this desperate
step was Ludwig von Mises; his advice, had it been heeded, would
have transformed national economies into a heap of ruins. (195)</P>

<P>Most of the confusion existing in monetary theory was due to
the separation of politics and economics, this outstanding characteristic
of market society. For more than a century, money was regarded
as a purely economic category, a commodity used for the purpose
of indirect exchange. If gold was the commodity so preferred,
a gold standard was in being. (The attribute &quot;international&quot;
in connection with that standard was meaningless, since for the
economist, no nations existed transactions were carried on not
between nations but between individuals, whose political allegiance
was as irrelevant as the color of their hair.) Ricardo indoctrinated
nineteenth century England with the conviction that the term &quot;money&quot;
meant a medium of exchange, that bank notes were a mere matter
of convenience, their utility consisting in their being easier
to handle than gold, but that their value derived from the certainty
that their possession provided us with the means of possessing
ourselves at any time of the commodity itself, gold. It followed
that the national characer of currencies was of no consequence,
since they were but different tokens representing the same commodity.
And if it was injudicious for a government to make any effort
to possess itself of gold (since the distribution of that commodity
regulated itself on the world market just as that of any other),
it was even more injudicious to imagine that the nationally different
tokens were of any relevance to the welfare and prosperity of
the countries concerned. (195, 196)</P>

<P>Now the institutional separation of the political and economic
spheres had never been complete, and it was precisely in the matter
of currency that it was necessarily incomplete; the state, whose
Mint seemed merely to certify the weight of coins, was in fact
the guarantor of the value of token money, which it accepted in
payment for taxes and otherwise. This money was not a means of
exchange, it was a means of payment; it was not a commodity, it
was purchasing power; far from having utility itself, it was merely
a counter embodying a quantified claim to things that might be
purchased. Clearly, a society in which distribution depended upon
the possession of such tokens of purchasing power was a construction
entirely different from market economy. (196)</P>

<P>We are not dealing here, of course, with pictures of actuality,
but with conceptual patterns used for the purposes of clarification.
No market economy separated from the political sphere is possible;
yet it was such a construction which underlay classical economics
since David Ricardo and apart from which its concepts and assumptions
were incomprehensible. Society, according to this &quot;lay-out&#148;
consisted of bartering individuals possessing an outfit of commodities
- goods, land, labor, and their composites. Money was simply one
of the commodities bartered more often than another and, hence,
acquired for the purpose of use in exchange. Such a &quot;society&quot;
may be unreal; yet it contains the bare bones of the construction
from which the classical economists started. (196)</P>

<P>An even less complete picture of actuality is offered by a
purchasing-power economy. (The underlying theory has been elaborated
by F. Schafer, Wellington, New Zealand) Yet some of its features
resemble our actual society much more closely than the paradigm
of market economy. Let us try to imagine a &quot;society&quot;
in which every individual is endowed with a definite amount of
purchasing power, enabling him to claim goods each item of which
is provided with a price tag. Money in such an economy is not
a commodity; it has no usefulness in itself; its only use is to
purchase goods to which price tags are attached, very much as
they are in our shops today. (196, 197)</P>

<P>While the commodity money theorem was far superior to its rival
in the nineteenth century, when institutions conformed in many
essentials to the market pattern, since the beginning of the twentieth
century the conception of purchasing power gained steadily. With
the disintegration of the gold standard, commodity money practically
ceased to exist, and it was only natural that the purchasing power
concept of money should replace it. (197)</P>

<P>To turn from mechanisms and concepts to the social forces in
play, it is important to realize that the ruling classes themselves
lent their support to the management of the currency through the
central bank. Such management was not, of course, regarded as
an interference with the institution of the gold standard; on
the contrary, it was part of the rules of the game under which
the gold standard was supposed to function. Since maintenance
of the gold standard was axiomatic and the central banking mechanism
was never allowed to act in such away as to make a country go
off gold, but, on the contrary, the supreme directive of the bank
was always and under all conditions to stay on gold, no question
of principle seemed to be involved. But this was so only as long
as the movements of the price level involved were the paltry 2-3
per cent, at the most, that separated the so-called gold points.
As soon as the movement of the internal price level necessary
to keep the exchanges stable was much larger, when it jumped to
10 per cent or 30 per cent, the situation was entirely changed.
Such downward movements of the price level would spread misery
and destruction. The fact that currencies were managed became
of prime importance, since it meant that central banking methods
were a matter of policy i.e., something the body politic might
have to decide about. Indeed, the great institutional significance
of central banking lay in the fact that monetary policy was thereby
drawn into the sphere of politics. The consequences could not
be other than far reaching. (197, 198)</P>

<P>They were twofold. In the domestic field, monetary policy was
only another form of interventionism, and clashes of economic
classes tended to crystallize around this issue so intimately
linked with the gold standard and balanced budgets. Internal conflicts
in the thirties, as we will see, often centered on this issue
which played an important part in the growth of the antidemocratic
movement. (198)</P>

<P>In the foreign field, the role of national currencies was of
overwhelming importance, though this fact was but little recognized
at the time. The ruling philosophy of the nineteenth century was
pacifist and internationalist; &quot;in principle&quot; all educated
people were free traders, and, with qualifications which appear
ironically modest today, they were no less so in practice. The
source of this outlook was, of course, economic; much genuine
idealism sprang from the sphere of barter and trade - by a supreme
paradox man's selfish wants were validating his most generous
impulses. But since the 1870's an emotional change was noticeable
though there was no corresponding break in the dominant ideas.
The world continued to believe in internationalism and interdependence,
while acting on the impulses of nationalism and self- sufficiency.
Liberal nationalism was developing into national liberalism, with
its marked leanings towards protectionism and imperialism abroad,
monopolistic conservatism at home. Nowhere was the contradiction
as sharp and yet as little conscious as in the monetary realm.
For dogmatic belief in the international gold standard continued
to enlist men's stintless loyalties, while at the same time token
currencies were established, based on the sovereignty of the various
central banking systems. Under the aegis of international principles,
impregnable bastions of a new nationalism were being unconsciously
erected in the shape of the central banks of issue. (198)</P>

<P>In truth, the new nationalism was the corollary of the new
internationalism. The international gold standard could not be
borne by the nations whom it was supposed to serve, unless they
were secured against the dangers with which it threatened the
communities adhering to it. Completely monetarized communities
could not have stood the ruinous effects of abrupt changes in
the price level necessitated by the maintenance of stable exchanges
unless the shock was cushioned by the means of an independent
central banking policy. The national token currency was the certain
safeguard of this relative security since it allowed the central
bank to act as a buffer between the internal and the external
economy. If the balance of payment was threatened with illiquidity,
reserves and foreign loans would tide over the difficulty; if
an altogether new economic balance had to be created involving
a fall in the domestic price level, the restriction of credit
could be spread in the most rational fashion, eliminating the
inefficient, and putting the burden on the efficient. Absence
of such a mechanism would have made it impossible for any advanced
country to stay on gold without devastating effects as to its
welfare, whether in terms of production, income, or employment.
(198, 199)</P>

<P>If the trading class was the protagonist of market economy,
the banker was the born leader of that class. Employment and earnings
depended upon the profitability of business, but the profitability
of business depended upon stable exchanges and sound credit conditions,
both of which were under the care of the banker. It was part of
his creed that the two were inseparable. A sound budget and stable
intemal credit conditions presupposed stable foreign exchanges;
also exchanges could not be stable unless domestic credit was
safe and the financial household of the state in equilibrium.
Briefly, the banker's twin trust comprised sound domestic finance
and external stability of the currency. That is why bankers as
a class were the last to notice it when both had lost their meaning.
There is indeed nothing surprising either in the dominating influence
of international bankers in the twenties, nor in their eclipse
in the thirties. In the twenties, the gold standard was still
regarded as the precondition of a return to stability and prosperity,
and consequently no demand raised by its professional guardians,
the bankers, was deemed too burdensome, if only it promised to
secure stable exchange rates; when, after 1929, this proved impossible,
the imperative need was for a stable internal currency and nobody
was as little qualified to provide it as the banker. (199)</P>

<P>In no field was the breakdown of market economy as abrupt as
in that of money. Agrarian tariffs interfering with the importing
of the produce of foreign lands broke up free trade; the narrowing
and regulating of the labor market restricted bargaining to that
which the law left to the parties to decide. But neither in the
case of labor nor in that of land was there a formal sudden and
complete rift in the market mechanism such as happened in the
field of money. There was nothing comparable in the other markets
to the relinquishing of the gold standard by Great Britain on
September 21, 1931; nor even to the subsidiary event of America's
similar action, in June, 1933. Though by that time the Great Depression
which began in 1929 had swept away the major part of world trade,
this meant no change in methods, nor did it affect the ruling
ideas. But final failure of the gold standard was the final failure
of market economy. (199, 200)</P>

<P>Economic liberalism had started a hundred years before, and
had been met by a protectionist countermove, which now broke into
the last bastion of market economy. A new set of ruling ideas
superseded the world of the self-regulating market. To the stupefaction
of the vast majority of contemporaries, unsuspected forces of
charismatic leadership and autarchist isolationism broke forth
and fused societies into new forms. (200)
