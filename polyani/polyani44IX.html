<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>THE PROBLEM of poverty centered around two closely related
subjects: pauperism and political economy.  Though we will deal
with their impact on modern consciousness separately, they formed
part of one indivisible whole: the discovery of society. (103)</P>

<P>Up to the time of Speenhamland no satisfactory answer could
be found to the question of where the poor come from.  It was,
however, generally agreed among eighteenth century thinkers that
pauperism and progress were inseparable.  The greatest number
of poor is not to be found in barren countries or amidst barbarous
nations, but in those which are the most fertile and the most
civilized, wrote John M'Farlane, in 1782. Giammaria Ortes, the
Italian economist, pronounced it an axiom that the wealth of a
nation corresponds with its population; and its misery corresponds
with its wealth (1774).  And even Adam Smith in his cautious manner
declared that it is not in the richest countries that the wages
of labor are highest.  M'Farlane was not, therefore, venturing
an unusual view when he expressed his belief that as England had
now approached the meridian of her greatness, the &quot;number
of poor will continue to increase.&quot; (M'Farlane, J., Enquiries
Concerning the Poor, 1782.  Cf. also Postlethwayt's editorial
remark in the Universal Dictionary of  1757 on the Dutch Poor
Law of 7th October, 1531) (103)</P>

<P>Again, for an Englishman to forecast commercial stagnation
was merely to echo a widely held opinion.  If the rise in exports
during the half century preceding 1782 was striking, the ups and
downs of trade were even more so.  Trade was just starting to
recover from a slump which had reduced export figures to the level
of almost half a century before.  To contemporaries the great
expansion of trade and apparent growth of national prosperity
which followed upon the Seven Years' War merely signified that
England too had bad her chance after Portugal, Spain, Holland,
and France.  Her steep rise was now a matter of the past, and
there was no reason to believe in the continuance of her progress,
which seemed merely the result of a lucky war.  Almost unanimously,
as we saw, a falling off of trade was expected. (103)</P>

<P>In actual fact, prosperity was just round the corner, a prosperity
of gigantic proportions which was destined to become a new form
of life not for one nation alone but for the whole of mankind.
 But neither statesmen nor economists had the slightest intimation
of its oncoming.  As for the statesmen, this may have been a matter
of indifference, as for another two generations the rocketing
trade figures only dented the edge of popular misery.  But in
the case of the economists it was singularly unfortunate as their
whole theoretical system was erected during this spate of &quot;abnormalcy,&quot;
when a tremendous rise in trade and production happened to be
accompanied by an enormous increase in human misery - in effect,
the apparent facts on which the principles of Malthus, Ricardo,
and James Mill were grounded reflected merely paradoxical tendencies
prevailing during a sharply defined period of transition. (104)</P>

<P>The situation was indeed puzzling.  It was in the first half
of the sixteenth century that the poor first appeared in England;
they became conspicuous as individuals unattached to the manor,
&quot;or to any feudal superior&quot; and their gradual transformation
into a class of free laborers was the combined result of the fierce
persecution of vagrancy and the fostering of domestic industry
which was powerfully helped by a continuous expansion of foreign
trade.  During the course of the seventeenth century there was
less mention of pauperism, even the incisive measure of the Act
of Settlement was passed without public discussion.  When by the
end of the century discussion revived, Thomas More's Utopia and
the early Poor Laws were more than 150 years old, the dissolution
of the monasteries and Kett's Rebellion were long forgotten. 
Some enclosing and &quot;engrossing&quot; had been going on all
the time, for example, during the reign of Charles I, but the
new classes as a whole had become settled.  Also while the poor
in the middle of the sixteenth century were a danger to society,
on which they descended like hostile armies, at the end of the
seventeenth century the poor were merely a burden on the rates.
 On the other hand, this was no more a semifeudal society but
a semicommercial one, the representative members of which were
favoring work for its own sake, and could accept neither the medieval
view that poverty was no problem, nor that of the successful encloser
that the unemployed were merely able-bodied idlers.  From this
time onward, opinions about pauperism began to reflect philosophical
outlook, very much as theological questions had before.  Views
on the poor mirrored more and more views on existence as a whole.
 Hence, the variety and seeming confusion in these views, but
also their paramount interest to the history of our civilization.
(104, 105)</P>

<P>The Quakers, these pioneers in the exploration of the possibilities
of modern existence, were the first to recognize that involuntary
unemployment must be the outcome of some defect in the organization
of labor. With their strong faith in businesslike methods they
applied to the poor amongst themselves that principle of collective
self-help which they occasionally practiced as conscientious objectors
when wishing to avoid supporting the authorities by paying for
their keep in prison. Lawson, a zealous Quaker, published an Appeal
to the Parliament concerning the Poor that there be no beggar
in England as a &quot;Platforme,&quot; in which he suggested the
establishment of Labor Exchanges in the modern sense of the public
employment agency.  This was in 1660; an &quot;Office of Addresses
and Encounters&quot; had been proposed ten years before by Henry
Robinson.  But the Restoration government favored more pedestrian
methods; the tendency of the Act of Settlement in 1662 was directly
contrary to any rational system of labor exchanges, which would
have created a wider market for labor; settlement - a term used
for the first time in the Act - bound labor to the parish. (105)</P>

<P>After the Glorious Revolution (1688), Quaker philosophy produced
in John Bellers a veritable prognosticator of the trend of social
ideas of the distant future.  It was out of the atmosphere of
the Meetings of Sufferings, in which statistics were now often
used to give scientific precision to religious policies of relief,
that, in 1696, his suggestion for the establishment of &quot;Colleges
of Industry&quot; was born, in which the involuntary leisure of
the poor could be turned to good account.  Not the principles
of a Labor Exchange, but the very different ones of exchange of
labor underlay this scheme.  The former was associated with the
conventional idea of finding an employer for the unemployed; the
latter implied no less than that laborers need no employer as
long as the can exchange their products directly.  &quot;The labor
of the poor being the mines of the rich,&quot; as BeHers said,
why should they not be able to support themselves by exploiting
those riches for their own benefit, leaving even something over?
 All that was needed was to organize them in a &quot;College&quot;
or corporation, where they could pool their efforts.  This was
at the heart of all later socialist thought on the subject of
poverty, whether it took the form of Owen's Villages of Union,
Fourier's Phalansteres, Proudhon's Banks of Exchange, Louis Blanc's
Ateliers Nationaux, Lassalle's Nationale Werkstatten, or for that
matter, Stalin's Five-Year Plans.  Bellers' book contained in
nuce most of the proposals that have been connected with the solution
of this problem ever since the first appearance of those great
dislocations that the machine produced in modern society.  &quot;This
college-fellowship will make labor and not money, the standard
to value all necessaries by......... &#147;It was planned as &quot;a
College of all sorts of useful trades that shall work for one
another without relief. ...&#148; The thinking of labor-notes,
self-help, and cooperation is significant. The laborers, to the
number of three hundred, were to be self-supporting, and work
in common for their bare existence, &quot;what any doth more,
to be paid for it.&quot; Thus subsistence rations and payment
according to results were to be combined.  In the case of some
minor experiments of self-help the financial surplus had gone
to the Meeting of Sufferings and was spent for the benefit of
other members of the religious community.  This surplus was destined
to have a great future; the novel idea of profits was the panacea
of the age.  Bellers' national scheme for the relief of unemployment
was actually to be run for profit by capitalists!  In the same
year, 1696, John Cary promoted the Bristol Corporation for the
Poor, which, after some initial success failed to yield profits
as did, ultimately, all other ventures of the kind.  Yet Bellers'
proposal was built on the same assumption as John Locke's labor-rate
system, put forward also in 1696, according to which the village
poor should be allocated to the local ratepayers for work, in
the proportion in which these latter were contributing to the
rates.  This was the<BR>
origin of the ill-starred system of roundsmen practiced under
Gilbert's Act.  The idea that pauperism could be made to pay had
firmly gripped people's minds. (105, 106)</P>

<P>It was exactly a century later that Jeremy Bentham, the most
prolific of all social projectors, formed the plan of using paupers
on a large scale to run machinery devised by his even more inventive
brother, Samuel, for the working of wood and metal.  &quot;Bentham,&quot;
says Sir Leslie Stephen, &quot;had joined his brother and they
were looking out for a steam engine.  It had now occurred to them
to employ convicts instead of steam.&quot; This was in 1794 ;
Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon plan with the help of which gaols
could be designed so as to be cheaply and effectively supervised
had been in existence for a couple of years, and he now decided
to apply it to his convict-run factory; the place of the convicts
was to be taken by the poor.  Presently the Bentham brothers'
private business venture merged into a general scheme of solving
the social problem as a whole.  The decision of the Speenhamland
magistrates, Whitbread's minimum wage proposal, and, above all,
Pitt's privately circulated draft of a comprehensive Bill for
the reform of the Poor Law made pauperism a topic among statesmen.
 Bentham, whose criticism of Pitt's Bill was supposed to have
brought about its withdrawal, now came forward in Arthur Young's
Annals with elaborate proposals of his own (1797).  His Industry-Houses,
on the Panopticon plan - five storeys in twelve sectors - for
the exploitation of the labor of the assisted poor were to be
ruled by a central board set up in the capital and modeled on
the Bank of England's Board, all members with shares worth five
or ten pounds having a vote.  A text published a few years later
ran: &quot;(1) The management of the concerns of the poor throughout
South Britain to be vested in one authority, and the expense to
be charged upon one fund. (2) This Authority, that of a Joint-Stock
Company under some such name as that of the National Charity Company.&quot;
(Bentham, J., Pauper Management.  First published 1797) No less
than 250 Industry Houses were to be erected, with approximately
500,000 inmates.  The plan was accompanied by a detailed analysis
of the various categories of unemployed, in which Bentham anticipated
by more than a century the results of other investigators in this
field.  His classifying mind showed its capacity for realism at
its best.  &quot;Out of place hands&quot; who had been recently
dismissed from jobs were distinguished from such as could not
find employment on account of &quot;casual-stagnation&quot;; &quot;periodical
stagnation&quot; of seasonal workers was distinguished from &#147;superseded
hands,&quot; such as had been &quot;rendered superfluous by the
introduction of machinery&quot; or, in even more modern terms,
from the technologically unemployed; a last group consisted of
&quot;disbanded hands,&quot; another modern category brought into
prominence, in Bentham's time, by the French war.  The most significant
category, however, was that of &quot;casual-stagnation,&quot;
mentioned above, which included not only craftsmen and artists
exercising occupations &quot;dependent upon fashion&quot; but
also the much more important group of those unemployed &quot;in
the event of a general stagnation of manufactures.&quot; Bentham's
plan amounted to no less than the leveling out of the business
cycle through the commercialization of unemployment on a gigantic
scale. (106, 107)</P>

<P>Robert Owen, in 1819, republished Bellers' more than 120-year-old
plans for the setting up of Colleges of Industry.  Sporadic destitution
had now grown into a torrent of misery. His own Villages of Union
differed from Bellers&#146; mainly by being much larger, comprising
1,200 persons on as many acres of land. The committee calling
for subscriptions to this highly experimental plan to solve the
problem of unemployment included no less an authority than David
Ricardo. But no subscribers appeared.  Somewhat later, the Frenchman
Charles Fourier was ridiculed for expecting day by day the sleeping-partner
to invest in his Phalanstere plan, which was based on ideas very
similar to those sponsored by one of the greatest contemporary
experts on finance.  And had not Robert Owens firm in New Lanark
- with Jeremy Bentham as a sleeping- partner - become world-famous
through the financial success of its philanthropic schemes?  There
was yet no standard view of poverty nor any accepted way of making
profits out of the poor. (107, 108)</P>

<P>Owen took over from Bellers the labor-note idea and applied
it in his National Equitable Labor Exchange in 1832; it failed.
 The closely related principle of economic self-sufficiency of
the laboring class - also an idea of Bellers - was at the back
of the famous Trades-Union movement in the next two years. The
Trades-Union was a general association of all trades, crafts and
arts, not excluding small masters, with the vague purpose of 
constituting them the body of society, in one peaceful manifestation.
 Who would have thought that this was the embryo of all violent
One Big Union attempts for a hundred years to come? Syndicalism
capitalism, socialism, and anarchism were indeed indistinguishable
in their plans for the poor.  Proudhon's Bank of Exchange, the
first practical exploit of philosophical anarchism, in 1848, was
, essentially, an outgrowth of Owen's experiment.  Marx, the state-socialist,
sharply assailed Proudhon's ideas and henceforth it was the state
that would be called upon to supply the capital for collectivist
schemes of this type, of which Louis Blanc's and Lassalle's went
down to history. (108)</P>

<P>The economic reason why no money could be made out of the paupers
should have been no mystery.  It was given almost 150 years before
by Daniel Defoe whose pamphlet, published in 1704, stalled the
discussion started by Bellers and Locke.  Defoe insisted that
if the poor were relieved, they would not work for wages; and
that if they were put to manufacturing goods in public institutions,
they would merely create more unemployment in private manufactures.
 His pamphlet bore the satanistic title: Giving Alms no Charity
and employing the Poor a Grievance to the Nation, and was followed
by Doctor Mandeville's more famous doggerels about the sophisticated
bees whose community was prosperous only because it encouraged
vanity and envy, vice and waste.  But while the whimsical doctor
indulged in a shallow moral paradox, the pamphleteer had hit upon
basic elements of the new political economy.  His essay was soon
forgotten outside the circles of &quot;inferior politics,&quot;
as problems of policing were called in the eighteenth century,
while Mandeville's cheap paradox exercised minds of the quality
of a Berkeley, Hume, and Smith.  Evidently, in the first half
of the eighteenth century mobile wealth was still a moral issue,
while poverty was not yet one.  The Puritan classes were shocked
by the feudal forms of conspicuous waste which their conscience
condemned as luxury and vice, while they had reluctantly to agree
with Mandeville's bees that but for those evils commerce and trade
would quickly decay.  Later these wealthy merchants were to be
reassured about the morality of business: the new cotton mills
did not cater any more to idle ostentation but to drab daily needs,
and subtle forms of waste developed which pretended to be less
conspicuous while managing to be even more wasteful than the old.
 Defoe's jibe at the perils of relieving the poor was not topical
enough to penetrate consciences preoccupied with the moral dangers
of wealth; the Industrial Revolution was still to come.  And yet,
as far as it went, Defoe's paradox was a forecast of the perplexities
to come: &quot;Giving alms no charity&quot; -<BR>
for in taking away the edge of hunger one hindered production
and merely created famine; &quot;employing the poor, a grievance
to the nation&quot; - for by creating public employment one merely
increased the glut of the goods on the market and hastened the
ruin of private traders.  Between John Bellers, the Quaker, and
Daniel Defoe, the time-serving journalist, between saint and cynic,
somewhere around the turn of the seventeenth century, the issues
were raised to which more than two centuries of work and thought,
hope and suffering, were to provide the laborious solutions. (108,
109)</P>

<P>But at the time of Speenhamland the true nature of pauperism
was still hidden from the minds of men.  There was complete agreement
on the desirability of a large population, as large as possible,
since the power of the state consisted in men.  There was also
ready agreement on the advantages of cheap labor, since only if
labor were cheap could manufactures flourish.  Moreover, but for
the poor, who would man the ships and go to the wars?  Yet, there
was doubt whether pauperism was not an evil after all.  And in
any case, why should not paupers be as profitably employed for
public profit as they obviously were for private profit?  No convincing
answer to these questions could be given.  Defoe had chanced upon
the truth which seventy years later Adam Smith may or may not
have comprehended; the undeveloped condition of the market system
concealed its inherent weaknesses.  Neither the new wealth nor
the new poverty was yet quite comprehensible. (109, 110)</P>

<P>That the question was in its chrysalid stage was shown by the
amazing congruence of the projects reflecting minds as different
as those of the Quaker Bellers, the atheist Owen, and the utilitarian
Bentham.  Owen, a socialist, was an ardent believer in the equality
of man and his inborn rights; while Bentham despised equalitarianism,
ridiculed the rights of man and bent heavily towards laissez-faire.
 Yet Owen's &quot;parallelograms&quot; resembled Bentham's Industry-Houses
so closely that one might imagine he was solely inspired by them
until his indebtedness to Bellers is remembered.  All three men
were convinced that an appropriate organization of the labor of
the unemployed must produce a surplus; which Bellers, the humanitarian,
hoped to use primarily for the relief of other sufferers; Bentham,
the utilitarian liberal, wanted to turn over to the shareholders;
Owen, the socialist, wished to return to the unemployed themselves.
 But while their differences merely revealed the almost imperceptible
signs of future rifts, their common illusions disclosed the same
radical misunderstanding of the nature of pauperism in the nascent
market economy. More important than all other differences between
them, there had been meanwhile a continuous growth in the number
of the poor: in 1696, when Bellers wrote, total rates approximated
400,000 pounds; in 1796, when Bentham struck out against Pitt's
bill, they must have passed the 2 million mark; by 1818, Robert
Owen's beginnings, they were nearing 8 million.  In the 120 years
that elapsed between Bellers and Owen the population may have
trebled, but rates increased twentyfold.  Pauperism had become
a portent.  But its meaning was still anybody's guess. (110)
