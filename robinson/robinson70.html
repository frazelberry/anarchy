  <P>The usual means of establishing dominance of one individual
  over others is the same as that used for the defence of territory.
  Thus amongst lemurs who mark out their territory by means of
  scent, one will challenge another to a stink fight, and the winner
  establishes dominance when the loser admits defeat. Lorenz has
  pointed out the importance of a ritual for surrender and a mechanism
  in the victor that inhibits further attack when the signal of
  surrender is given. (Doves who do not normally fight, lack this
  mechanism, so that when, through the accident of being caged
  together, they get into a fight, they fight to the death.) The
  fact that the response of recognizing the dominance of a superior
  is as much innate as the impulse to seek dominance over an inferior
  is established by a curious story. By accident., a lemur of one
  species was accepted into a troop of another species. He did
  not have their particular kind of stink glands or the capacity
  to recognize their stink. Thus he never knew when he was beaten
  and rose to a high position of dominance amongst them. (19)</P>
  <P>Probably the mode of evolution of language can never be discovered,
  however many anthropoid skulls are dug up. The observation that
  apes lack the capacity (with which birds, and perhaps dolphins
  are endowed) to imitate new sounds suggests that there was a
  great leap along the path of evolution after the side-road that
  led to the apes had left the main line. Language and the social
  and technical innovations which it made possible obviously had
  survival value. There is no reason to doubt that language evolved
  under the pressure of natural selection like other capcities,
  such as the problem-solving intelligence of the monkeys which
  defeated the lemurs. But once conceptual thought had been arrived
  at, it proved to have enormous possibilities that were, so to
  say, surplus to the requirements of physical existence. The interplay
  of consciousness with environment, of freedom with necessity,
  which is the characteristic of human life, was the consequence
  of the acquisition of language over and above its technical advantage
  for survival. (23)</P>
  <P>In so-called civilized societies it is the poor who spend
  their days in an anxious search for the means to live and the
  rich who can indulge in gratuitous activities; but when we compare
  rich and poor societies, the reverse often appears. The isolated
  communitites, when they were discovered and brought into the
  frame of reference to national income per- head, were placed
  very low on the scale, yet for many of them the proportion of
  energy, skill and mental activity devoted to non-economic aims
  was much greater than it is with us. (25)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor527251"></A>A highly developed system which
  was devoted to continuous and energetic accumulation without
  stultifying itself by a progressive concentration of wealth grew
  up amongst the Indians of North-west Canada. A man could acquire
  a place in a fixed hierarchy of honourable titles by birth, by
  marriage, or by wiping out the former holder in battle. To validate
  the succession to a title required a potlatch ceremony - a lavish
  feast with a greatest possible distribution of wealth to the
  assembled tribes. Each potlatch was a challenge to the guests
  that had to be met by a greater distribution in turn. The culminating
  feat in the contest was the destruction of valuables. Certain
  copper discs embodied the acme of prestige (like the highest
  ranking coins in Rossel Island); one chief could defeat another
  by throwing the most esteemed disc into the fire. To back up
  their own chief and save him from shame, each tribe was engaged
  in accumulating stocks; and minor potlatches were carried out
  by commoners to celebrate events in their own families; thus
  great energy was called forth and productive activity kept at
  stretch. Contact with fur-traders brought easy riches to the
  tribes and factory-made blankets became the chief currency in
  the Potlatch. At the same time war was discouraged as an alternative
  means of establishing social prestige. The Potlatch system hypertrophied
  and the distribution and destruction of wealth became more and
  more extravagant. The Canadian administration outlawed the Potlatch
  in the name of proper economic principles, but it took a century
  to stamp out the practice and reduce the proud tribesmen to getting
  a mere living in the lower ranks of civilized society. (28.,

  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor472144"></A>Now the concept of property in
  land came into consciousness. Even in the system of shifting
  cultivation, it was convenient for each family to have its own
  garden within the burned patch, but each could have as much as
  they had labour and seed to cultivate; the area to be burned
  could be chosen to acommodate everyone. There was no cause for
  conflict and the legal system -- that each family had a right
  to the crop that they had grown -- no doubt seemed too obvious
  to need remark. This economic base could accommodate a great
  variety of systems of kinship and networks of mutual obligations
  such as have been observed among the isolated societies. With
  the plough, the legal system had to be adjusted to new technical
  conditions. Some tribes in Africa maintain to this day a system
  of common ownership. The land theoretically belongs to the chief,
  who distributes it to be worked in proportion ot the labour available.
  Family inheritance, however, was a fairly obvious notion, and
  it proved to be a technical advantage since it brought the strong
  motive of family feeling into play as a stimulus to work and
  save. Matrilineal inheritance was the most straightfoward system
  (it is a wise man who knows his own father) but where it still
  exists, a man finds it annoying to have to contribute to the
  income of his sister's children, not his own. When animal husbaridry
  took over from hunting and the plough took over from the digging
  stick, the economic position of men became dominant and patrilineal
  inheritance came into fashion. (37, 38)</P>
  <P>In medieval Europe, a system was developed of a fallow of
  one year in three; animals grazing the fallow land manured it.
  This system involved a whole village working on a common plan;
  each family had some land in each area so that they could claim
  a crop each year. (38)</P>
  <P>In Asian conditions individual cultivation was the rule, though
  mutual aid in rush seasons was customary in some neighbourhoods.
  Tradition and prudent attachment to known methods imposed almost
  as much uniformity as the common programme required by the three
  field system. (38)</P>
  <P>Even from neolithic times there were evidently specialists;
  mining and making flint tools and weapons requried knowledge
  and skill as well as access to special natural resources. (Whether
  particular individuals were whole-time specialists or not must
  have depended upon the size of the community. In a small group,
  the specialists would spend part of their time as ordinary cultivators.)
  Specialization entails exchange. Adam Smith argued that, between
  equals, goods would exchange at the ratio of the amounts of labour
  needed to produce them but an equal amount of labour had no meaning
  where, by the nature of the case, each sort of labour was different.
  From the earliest times various kinds of services were, no doubt,
  valued at different rates --the priest was more honoured than
  the barber--- and the payment in terms of grain for the skill
  of the blacksmith or the thatcher had to be set at a level that
  would allow them what the community considered a suitable standard
  of life. ... (40)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor633786"></A>Under whatever systems of inheritance,
  the chances of family life would bring about changes in the relation
  of property in land to labour available to work it, so that some
  families would find themselves with more land than they could
  cultivate and some with less. Moreover differences of temperament
  come in. Some men are industrious and acquisitive, others feckless,
  idle or generous. There is a certain tendency to check accumulation.
  The richer family marries its children earlier, so that numbers
  increase faster and land per head is reduced in the third generation.
  But this tendency has generally proved too weak to offset the
  forces pressing against equality. In a society which allows inequality
  of possessions between families, it perpetuates itself. Those
  with excess land can make use of the labour of others, either
  by employing them at wages or letting land to them for a share
  of the produce. Either way, property becomes a source of income
  independently of its owner's work. (41)</P>
  <P>Where crops are seasonal, another source of property income
  presents itself. Even where there is land available to be broken
  in to cultivation to take advantage of it a man needs supplies
  of seed, tools, perhaps draft animals, and certainly subsistence
  over the period from seed time to harvest. Those who have not
  enough to live upon till the next harvest can maintain themselves
  by taking a loan, promising repayment when the harvest comes
  in. From this the conception of interest -- repayment by more
  than what was received, naturally arises. Thus a family which
  enjoys a surplus over its needs can increase its income still
  further by lending at interest. The maximum interest that can
  be extracted is the difference between what a man can produce
  in a year's work on the land available and what he must consume
  to live. Within that limit, the rate may be settled by custom
  at some round figure. Among the Hausa, before they were drawn
  into the modern monetary economy, &#145;two bundles of guinea
  corn had to be repaid at harvest for every one lent in the early
  farming season or, if the lender was generous, three bundles
  for every two lent.' Thus a man who had twice as much corn has
  he needed to consume could eat one portion and lend one. He would
  then recieve the whole back at the next harvest, lend half again,
  and so continue indefinitely without doing any more work or saving,
  living upon 'unearned income'. The generous lender who charged
  50 per cent instead of 100 per cent was presumably a landowner
  who did not care to take full advantage of the poverty of his
  neighbours. The prohibition of interest and the jubilee year
  at which all debts were cancelled in Hebrew law, were designed
  to check accumulation from this source. From the system of loans
  developed the system of pledging land as security. This enabled
  the wealthy families to acquire the holdings of defaulting debtors.
  Families which lost their land had to become wage earners or
  tenants. Since family life was bound up with property, a class
  of landowners could become established within which marriages
  took place, and a class of labourers who had only poverty to
  leave to their children. Romantic tales of the tragic conflict
  between love and duty were told in many languages. (41 - 43)</P>
  <P>An independent family owning sufficient land to support themselves
  could work as much as they felt to be worthwhile. (This freedom
  was limited where cultivation had to be in common, as in the
  threefield system, but even there some could take more trouble
  than others.) By putting in more work over a year the family
  would gain a greater product, either by cultivating a larger
  area of their holding or by more intensive work, for instance
  on weeding. They would aim to produce as much as they required
  to live without exerting themselves excessively. In economists'
  jargon, they would balance the utility of income against the
  disutility of work. A family which owned no land would have to
  work much harder. A sharecropper who has to give half the gross
  produce of a plot of land in order to be allowed to work on it
  must produce more than twice as much as a free family controlling
  the same area if he is to eat as well as they. (More than twice,
  for he is giving away half the gross produce and must find the
  seed from his own half). To gain twice the produce, he must work
  more than twice as hard. In economists' jargon, after a certain
  point there are dirriinishing returns to labour applied to a
  given area within a given agricultural technique so that, say,
  an extra 10 per-cent of man hours worked over- a year yields
  less than 10 per cent extra produce. Depending on the nature
  of the soil and the technique in use, it may be impossible for
  him to produce enough to support the same standard of ilfe as
  the independent family, so that he not only works harder but
  eats less. (43)</P>
  <P>At any moment, the level of rents and interest are fixed by
  custom and the use of round numbers, but there is a crude element
  of supply and demand in the situation. When the population is
  increasing, the demand for land is growing. The landlord can
  get tenants for smaller plots, so that they must work harder
  to live. The total produce of a given area rises and the landlord's
  income with it. Even if land is available for new settlement,
  the poor can make no use of it with their bare hands. Landlords
  can settle new villages and advance them what they need until
  they begin to pay. In economists' jargon, increase in population
  reduces the marginal product of labour and raises the marginal
  product of land, so that average income falls while the wealth
  of the landowner rises. Malthus startled the humanitarian eightheenth
  century with the doctrine that the growth of population everywhere
  exceeds the growth of food supplies, and will be held in check
  by misery and starvation. From the foregoing analysis of the
  consequences of family property in land it seems clear that the
  Malthusian misery would set in when (with the available technique)
  the maximum amount of labour that a man could put forth in a
  year was not able to yield enough to support life. But then he
  would have no surplus to hand over to the landlord or the money-lender.
  He is reduced to misery long before that stage is reached by
  their exactions.</P>
  <P>But if there were no landlords there would be no surplus,
  for free families would have no motive to produce more than they
  needed to consume. (44)</P>
  <P>Property interlacing with family relationships might generate
  a class of landowners in peaceful conditions but its most frequent
  origin has been in warfare. We do not know whether war developed
  first as a sport or as a form of hunting - to prey upon men when
  other game was scarce; we do know that no part of the world (except
  perhaps the arctic circle) has been immune from it in one form
  or the other. (45)</P>
  <P>Where neighbours are at the same technical level, with weapons
  which are not too powerful, like the stone-age peoples observed
  in New Guinea, warfare can go on indefinitely,. As the technical
  level rises, with the use of metals, the class system which may
  be loosely called feudalism emerges. The gentlemen fight and
  organize fighting, while the cultivators are obliged to support
  them by providing an agricultural surplus over and above their
  own consumption and to allow their sons to be recruited to fill
  the ranks of the armies. The cultivators in each area have a
  compelling motive to support their own gentlemen for if not the
  gentlemen of another area would raid and slaughter them.</P>
  <P>When one group can overwhelm another, by larger numbers, superior
  organization, the emergence of a powerful leader or the development
  of a higher level of effectiveness in weaponry, and tactics,
  then war becomes conquest. (45)</P>
  <P>More often the conquered people remained to work and hand
  over their surplus to new masters. When the conquerers were already
  organized in a social hierarchy, lands with cultivators to work
  them were allotted to gentlemen and lower ranks were stepped
  up above the new lowest order consisting of the old inhabitants
  of the land. Another economic use of warfare was the capture
  of slaves. ... A society, however, cannot consist only of gentlemen
  and slaves. there must be a sufficiently large free population
  of lower rnaks who identify themselves with the gentlemen and
  enable them to keep the slaves in order. ... continuous war was
  necessary to keep up the supplies of fresh captives. (46)</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor15910"></A>In another type of organization,
  a central government controlled both military and civil affairs;
  power and authority was embodied in the heir of a princely dynasty--
  a Pharaoh or an Inca -- who claimed the right to tribute directly
  from the cultivators and redistributed the surplus to his administrative
  officials and military commanders. A centre of military power
  can augment its income in two furtherways. The first is to subdue
  the governments of neighbouring lands, and leaving them in charge,
  to exact tribute from them which they are obliged to extract
  from the surplus of their own people. The second is to set up
  colonies to dominate the natives in outlying regions, or to cultivate
  their lands (with slaves or with the colonists' own labour) and
  to require remittances to the homeland. These four ways-- feudalism,
  central administration, imperialism and colonization-- in which
  the agricultural surplus can be extracted for the benefit of
  a dominant class, have been repeated, in various permutations
  and combinations, throughout history from neolithic times to
  the present day. (46, 47)</P>
  <P>Whether the land was worked by slaves, serfs or peasants,
  and the surplus was taken by independent gentlemen or by officers
  of a monarch, or of an imperialist power, the main lines of economic
  relations were the same. The surplus was consumed partly in maintaining
  a military establishment and partly in supporting the standard
  of life of the gentlemanly class. The expenditure of their households
  led to a great increase of handicraft production. Arms, dress,
  furniture, carriages, as well as works of art dedicated to the
  gods, required specialized skill. The few and simple craftsmen
  in the free villages were supported by contributions from the
  cultivators; now craftsmen were clients of the wealthy and earned
  a share of their rents by serving their requirements for martial
  power, comfort and display. (47)</P>
  <P>When a hundred families are paying half their produce to one
  landlord, his family does not want to eat a hundred times as
  much grain as a cultivator's .... Part of his share in the grain
  goes to support producers of agricultural raw materials (silk,
  cotton or wool) and miners or foresters., and the rest to supporting
  his clients. Those amongst them who are builders and manufacturers
  partly supply each other's needs. Thus the grain that the cultivator
  parts with becomes, through skill and art, transmogrified into
  great wealth and splendour-. (47)</P>
  <P>Cities grew up around forts where people and cattle could
  retire from attack, and around temples and palaces. Intermediate
  classes were established between the cultivators and the landowners,
  of craftsmen, traders, financiers and clerks to cater to the
  needs of the wealthy households and of priests and learned men
  who shared their benefits. (47, 48)</P>
  <P>Herodotus remarked that there were no markets in Persian cities.
  The process of supplying food and raw materials to an urban community
  could be organized by the collection of dues, storage and distribution
  as salaries, fees and offerings carried out in the name of the
  head of state. Similarly exchanges of goods and services within
  the urban community, and the values at which they took place,
  could be regulated by custom and ranks attached to various occupations.
  The concept of trade for profit presumably arose from exchanges
  between peoples who appeared to each other as foreigners, outside
  the rules and obligations of the domestic society. ... Phoenicians
  and Arabs who specialized in sea transport were under no ritual
  obligations at either end of the voyage. Aristotle deplored the
  unnatural actlivity of making money, which had become established
  in his day, compared to the natural activity of meeting the needs
  of the household and the community. (49)</P>
  <P>The concept of investment for the sake of profit also grew
  out of foreign trade. The merchant needed finance to provide
  the expenses of shipping, camel train or porters as well as the
  goods whose sale would replace the finance with an adequate excess
  to reward him for the risk and trouble and enable him to venture
  again on a larger scale. ... Whole cities flourished upon trade
  and a profession of financiers came into being. ... (50)</P>
  <P><A NAME="anchor39513"></A>A hierarchical society required
  to justify itself. Most often the dominance of one group of families
  over the rest was rationalized in terms of 'race'. The notion
  of 'us' and 'the others', connected with rules about whom it
  is proper to marry, arose wherever peoples of different language
  and habits were in contact with each other-. ... Now superiority
  became asymmetrical. Better fed, taught to cultivate strength
  and courage, or devoted to subtle scholarship, the benefi ciaries
  of the system could feel themselves different beings from the
  slaves or peasants who supported them, and could expect to be
  acknowledged as such. (50)</P>
  <P>Birth might establish power but talent was also necessary,
  for a state requires a bureaucracy and a legal system. For this,
  writing is a great convenience but it is not indispensable. In
  the highly elaborate organization of the Incas, intelligence
  was conveyed by knots in string. In the kingdom of Dahomey ...
  a census of every villge and a record of its taxable capacity
  was kept annually by a system of counting pebbles. (51)</P>
  <P>The one great empire which has a continuous recorded history
  from the bronze age to the present century developed bureaucracy
  to its highest level. The challenge of a scholar to the first
  Han emperor-: 'You conquered this country in a chariot - can
  you rule it from a chariot?' was repeated in every age of Chinese
  history. (The Mongol conquest was a brutal interruption of continuity
  but Kubla Khan took over the Chinese system of administration
  and so did the Manchu dynasty which saw the end of the story.)
  (51, 52)</P>
  <P>In China class was not based upon conceptions of 'race'. The
  Han people regarded themselves as all of one race; landlords
  recognized peasants in their villages as their fellow clansmen;
  in theory every one was free to become a mandarin. But to learn
  characters and study the classics required expensive tuition
  and years free from work. Coming from an illiterate home, even
  the most devoted could take only the first step in learning -
  it was said to take three generations to get through the national
  examination. Thus learning and soft hands not used to toil became
  the mark of superiority. ... (52)</P>
  <P>In China each dynasty established the divinity of its line;
  but Chinese political philsophy contained the principle of 'the
  mandate of heaven', which gave the people a legitimate right
  to overthrow a dynasty whose government degenerated. Perhaps
  the failure of the western Roman empire to find a satisfactory
  principle of succession contributed to its decline and fall.
  (53)</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>In Western Europe the money economy gradually invaded feudal
  agriculture. In England, feudalism had been super-imposed upon
  Saxon village communities practicing cultivation in the open
  field system. Rent was extracted by the lord owning a demesne
  (and sometimes strips in the open fields) which had to be cultivated
  without payment. The cultivators were serfs attached to the land.
  But servile labour is inefficient and troublesome to manage.
  Landlords gradually found it more convenient to employ full-time
  workers on the best parts of the demesne (with the services of
  the villagers at the harvest) and let off the rest of their lands
  for rent, in the form of commutation of dues expressed in terms
  of labour. (54)</P>
  <P>In the thirteenth century, it seems, a rise in population
  created a scarcity of land. Supply and demand favoured the landlords.
  By one means or another, the cultivators' share in production
  was squeezed down. Hungry, landless families were shaken out
  at the bottom of the social structure. ... (54, 55)</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>In England, the wool trade played a great part in finally
  digesting feudalism into the commercial system. The Black Death
  reduced the cultivated area needed for subsistence., leaving
  room for pastures, and at the same time the loss of rents inclined
  the landowners to look for another way of making their property
  field income. Moreover, the feudal style of consuming the surplus
  in fighting over the inheritance of titles was obsolescent. With
  the internal peace that the Tudor monarchy imposed upon the warring
  nobility, land began to be seen as a source of wealth calculated
  in money rather than of the command of a tenantry to arm and
  lead to battle. Sheep were more valuable than men. Numbers gradually
  recovered, but the landlords were no longer so keen to get tenants.

  the aristocracy, destroying fuedal privilege and breaking up
  the estates of the nobility and the church into small freeholds.
  Beyond that they had no use for radical ideas. Liberty, Equality

  <P>In Central Europe the Peasant revolts of the sixteenth century
  were defeated and bloddily repressed. In East Germany feudalism
  was modernized but not relaxed; serfdom was introduced into Russia.
  In the peninsula, feudalism freed the land from the Moors and
  went onto create overseas empries. its remnants survived to overthrow
  the shortlived Spanish republic of 1935, and to maintain the
  last African empries till today. In Sweden feudalism never took
  root so that no upheaval was needed to install democracy. In
  West Germany and Italy bourgeois societies grew up around the
  courts of princelings or on the proceeds of trade. (58)</P>
  <P>There was a technical reason why the mathematics of the ancient
  world had little application to technology. Algebra and geometry
  were developed as speculative philosophy but the humble uses
  of arithmetic were impeded by the clumsy system of numerals.

  In the fourteenth century the Church fought hard against the
  introduction of this system into Europe but its practical advantages
  were too great. Without it engineering would never have got far.
  (61)</P>
  <P>As now, misery did not prevent numbers from growing, but there
  was an enormous difference between the population explosion of
  the nineteenth century and that which is taking place today.
  Development of the New World, revolutionary improvements in transport
  and in manufactures to trade for agricultrual products, provided
  an ample supply of food. This is a piece of history that will
  not repeat itself. (62)</P>
  <P>The development of the factory system brought into being a
  new set of economic and social relationships. The most important
  was the great expansion of employment at wages. In an economy
  of peasants and artisans the worker commands the material factors
  of production that he operates. Wage labour had swallowed up
  peasant agriculture in the English system of farming; it was
  now extended to swallow up artisan manufacture. (62, 63)</P>
  <P>The spread of employment brought a corresponding expansion
  of investment to equip factories and furnish money capital to
  pay wages and purchase raw materials in advance of sales. (It
  was from this that the system took the name of capitalism.) The
  capitalist employer needed energy, ambition and business acumen.
  These very qualities led him to transcend pure exploitation.
  With a given method of production there is a limit to the profit
  that can be got per man employed. By raising output per head,
  profit could be increased. Capitalism quickly set technical progress
  on foot. (63)</P>
  <P>The exaltation of making money for its own sake to respectability,
  indeed to dominance in society was the new feature of the capitalist
  system which distinguished it from all former civilizations.
  (67)</P>
  <P>The racial concept of class - the inherent superiority of
  a land-owning family over the tenants and labourers - was undermined
  by the new wealth. In England it lingered on. The Victorian novels
  are concerned with the right of the professional classes to consider
  themselves gentlemen and gentlemen could not be concerned with
  trade. It was the last lingering remnant of feudal morality -
  the notion that status was something inborn that could not be
  bought. Deprived of divine right, the capitalists had to present
  themselves as benefactors to society. They 'gave employment',
  they built up the wealth of the nation and carried Christian
  civilization to barbarous lands. While prosperity lasted they
  could dismiss all who questioned their credentials as idealists
  and cranks. (67)</P>
  <P>'The produce of the earth - all that is derived from its surface
  by the united application of labour, machinery, and capital,
  is divided among three classes of the community; namely, the
  proprietor of the land, the owner of the stock or capital necessary
  for its cultivation, and the labourers by whose industry it is
  cultivated. 'But in different stages of societies, the proportions
  of the whole produce of the earth which will be allotted to each
  of these classes, under the names of rent, profit, and wages,
  will be essentially different; depending mainly on the actual
  fertility of the soil, on the acumulation of capital and population,
  and on the skill, ingenuity and instruments employed in agriculture.
  'To determine the laws which regulate this distribution is the
  principle problem in political economy.' (David Ricardo, <U>Principles
  of Political Economy</U>, Preface)</P>
  <P>'The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of
  production, which has sprung up and flourished along with, and
  under it. Centralization of the means of production and socialization
  of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible
  with their capitalist integument. The integument is burst assunder.
  The knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators
  are expropriated.' [<U>Capital</U>, Vol. I, Chapter XXXIII</P>
  <P>These notions naturally did not appeal to the industrialists
  and financiers, nor to the thick layers of middle-class rentiers
  and professionals which wre growing up betwen them and the industrial
  wage-earners. A more congenial version of the doctrine of progress
  was put out by Marshall. Through the profit system, the love
  of money was being harnessed to the service of society. Market
  demand guided production so that the needs and tastes of the
  consumers were catered for. Economies of scale and technical
  progress were reducing costs of production, and competition ensured
  that prices fell with costs, so that real wages were rising.
  The spread of education was eroding class differences; any family
  with the strength of mind to forgo &#145;present gratifications'
  by saving could claim a share of profit. (70)</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>'The problem of social aims takes on new forms in every age:
  but underlying all there is the one fundamental principle: viz.
  that progress mainly depends on the extent to which the strongest
  and not merely the highest, forces of human nature can be utilized
  for the increase of social good. There are some doubts as to
  what social good really is; but they do not reach far enough
  to impair the foundation of this fundamental principle. For there
  has always been a substratum of agreement that social good lies
  mainly in that healthful exercise and development of faculties
  which yields happiness without pall, because it sustains self-respect
  and is sustained by hope. No utilization of waste gasses in the
  blast furnace can compare with the triumph of making work for
  the public good pleasurable in itself, and of stimulating men
  of all classes to great endeavours by other means than that evidence
  of power which manifests itself by lavish expenditure. We need
  to foster fine work and fresh initiative by the warming breath
  of the sympathy and appreciation of those who truly understand
  it; we need to turn consumption into paths, that strengthen the
  consumer and call forth the best qualities of those who provide
  for consumption. Recognizing that some work must be done that
  is not ennobling, we must seek to apply the growing knowledge
  and material resources of the world to reduce such work within
  narrow limits, and to extirpate all conditions of life which
  are in themselves debasing. There cannot be a great sudden improvement
  in man's conditions of life; for he forms them as much as they
  form him, and he himself cannot change fast: but he must press
  on steadfastly towards the distant goal where the opportunities
  of a noble life may be accessible to all.' (Marshall, <U>Industry
  and Trade</U>, pp. 664-5)</P>
  <P>It is strange that Marshall published these words in 1919.
  (Though they were written much earlier). He was too old to notice
  that his pleasing prediction had been falsified. In Germany capitalism
  developed before feudalism had been displaced from agriculture,
  and feudal notions of war as the natural path to honour had not
  succumed to the morality of a nation of shopkeepers. The industrialists
  looked to the military to win them a share in the wealth of the
  world and the military encouraged the application of industrial
  technique to the production of arms. The quick victory of 1870
  seemed to vindicate this formula. The capitalist democracies
  were dragged into an arms race and war which radically changed
  the nature of the system. Capitalist imperialism of course, had
  depended upon military power, but it was turned only against
  peoples at a much lower technical level who were easily overcome.
  ... War between ndustrial powers was a very different matter.
  Ever since, the application of scientific technology to means
  of destruction, each war starting a little above the level at
  which the last ended, has changed Marshall's agreeable vision
  of industry at the service of mankind into a nightmare of terror.

  <P>Investment requires that men are employed and incomes earned
  in producing goods which will contribute to making profits in
  the future. Meanwhile they are not bringing anything to market.
  Incomes currently paid out in connection with them represent
  demand for goods already available and provide profits for businesses
  which can supply them. There is a 'seller's market' when demand
  has increased ahead of capacity to meet it. An initial rise in
  expenditure in investment thus raises the level of profits and
  makes further investment attractive. A boom is thus a self-contradictory
  situation. Investment is stimulated by profits which are generated
  by the investment itself. When the new capacity which investment
  has been creating becomes into use it competes with the old,
  the sellers market comes to an end, future pros&not; pects of
  profit are dimmed, new schemes of investment are insufficient
  to take the place of those that have been completed and a fall
  in employment and incomes takes place. (72)</P>
  <P>The war had speeded up a tendency that was in any case developing
  for a number of countries to set up industries to supply thier
  own needs and reduce their dependence upon exports from the already
  developed economies thus reduplicating productive capacity, and
  there had been a wave of technical improvements in the production
  of raw materials which increased supply ahead of demand. The
  capitalist world as a whole was sinking into the condition of
  a buyer's market. But in the United States, after a post-war
  boom and slump, a strong surge of investment set in. Investment,
  consumption and national income were rising more or less continuously
  from 1921 to 1929 an exceptionally long wave of preosperity which
  gave rise to the notion that America was different - that this
  was not a mere boom but a new age. There were some signs that
  the industrial expansion was beginning to flatten out in 1929,
  but the reaction would not have been so violent if it had not
  been for the financial boom. (73)</P>
  <P>The prices of shares on the Stock Exchange depends, as we
  saw above, upon what the market expects them to be. There had
  been a sharp post-war boom in reconverting industry to civilian
  uses, followed by a sharp slump, which brought share prices down.
  Then investment picked up and the earning power of the real assets
  which shares represented was steadily rising. A revaluation of
  shares began which at first corresponded to a sober calculation
  of expected profits. But soon the Stock Exchange boom took off
  on its own and soared away far above the industrial boom. (73)</P>
  <P>'The collapse in the stock market in the autumn of 1929 was
  implicit in the speculation that went before. The only question
  concerning that speculation was how long it would last. Sometime,
  sooner or later, confidence in the short-run reality of increasing
  common stock values would weaken. When this happened, some people
  would sell, and this would destroy the reality of increasing
  values. Holding for an increase would now become meaningless,
  the new reality would be falling prices. There would be a rush,
  pell-mell, to unload. This was the way past speculative orgies
  had ended. It was the way the end came in 1929. It is the way
  speculation will end in the f uture.' (J K Galbraith, <U>The
  Great Crash</U>, pp. 23-4)</P>
  <P>The boom meanwhile had been under-mining its own base. In
  an earlier phase there had been a fashion in the USA for buying
  foreign bonds. This had supported investment in a number of countries,
  particularly Germany, where it made it possible to finance reparations
  payments without building up a corresponding surplus of exports
  and to carry on investment at home. The attraction of speculation
  on Wall Street dried up the source of foreign loans and brought
  several countries into financial difficulties. Great Britain
  had been in chronic trouble, exacerbated by returning to the
  gold standard at an over-valued exchange rate. ... Australia
  and Latin America were feeling the effects of the sagging prices
  of primary products, which, as soon as industrial activity slackened
  fell to ruinous levels. Thus there was no resilience anywhere,
  and the American slump plunged the whole capitalist world into
  a steep decline of profits, activity and employment. (74, 75)</P>
  <P>It seemed as though Marx's diagnosis was coming true, that
  capitalism had had its day and was due to be superseded., but
  history still had more tricks up its sleeve. A new formula had
  been found in Italy. When a labourer movement was strong enough
  to be a serious threat to landlords and industrialists, the lower-middle
  class of shopkeepers, white collar workers and struggling professionals
  felt themselves to be between two fires. They found a champion
  who discovered that it was possible to recruit an army of malcontents
  and by indulging and cultivating the sadism that, it seems, is
  available in every population, to set up an appar&not; atus of
  terror to secure power. The respectable classes were partly intimidated
  and partly grateful for defence against a revolution from the
  left. Similarly, the respectable capitalist nations, through
  a mixture of fear and sympathy, allowed the new regime to have
  its head. Hitler set out to follow this formula in Germany. The
  present misery of massive unemployment and the nagging bitterness
  of past defeat provided support for him and he set about to deal
  with both at once by preparing for war. (75, 76)</P>
  <P>1 Meanwhile, history had been playing a trick on Marx. The
  international labour movement that should have opposed international
  capitalism fell apart when the workers of each nation lined up
  behind their governments in 1914 with fervent patriotism. But
  the collapse of the ramshackle autocracy of the Tsar in the war
  gave the believers in Marxism their opportunity and they found
  themselves in command of an empire where Capitalism, far from
  being overripe and rotting from within, had scarcely begun to
  take root. It turned out that socialism was not a stage beyond
  capitalism but an alternative means of carrying out industrialization.
  (76)</P>
  <P>'One element of these costs should be mentioned specifically.
  It consists in the absorption of ability in merely protective
  activities. A considerable part of the total work done by lawyers
  goes into the struggle of business with the state and its organs.
  It is immaterial whether we call this vicious obstruction of
  the common good or defence of the common good against vicious
  obstruction. In any case the fact remains that in socialist society
  there would be neither need nor room for this part of legal activity.
  The resulting saving is not satisfactorily measured by the fees
  of lawyers who are thus engaged. That is inconsiderable. But
  not inconsiderable is the social loss from such unproductive
  employment of many of the best brains. Considering how terribly
  rare good brains are, their shifting to other employments might
  be of more than infinitesimal importance'. (Joseph A Schumpeter,
  <U>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</U>, p 198)</P>
  <P>When private property in the means of production has been
  abolished the whole national income belongs to the whole population.
  The earnings of a worker are not wages in the same sense as under
  capitalism; they are his share in the grand cooperative enterprise.
  However, as a means of enforcing discipline and providing a motive
  for work, a system of payments indistinguishable from wages proved
  indispensable; socialism made much less difference to the daily
  life of an industrial worker than the visionaries had promised.
  For the manager of an enterprise life was different. Instead
  of being called upon to use his judgment as to how to make profits
  for his firm, he was given instructions in the form of specifications
  of output, costs, etc. in terms of which he had to make the best
  showing that he could. (79)</P>
  <P>There may have been some far-sighted government advisors who
  saw the arms race as a solution of the problem of maintaining
  economic stability, but it seems plausible to suppose that this
  formula came from a convergence of a variety of forces. The military
  and all the authorities who had risen to positions of power and
  honour in the war were reluctant to step down. A number of important
  industries would have suffered a severe decline if armaments
  production had fallen off; the scientists who had committed themselves
  to the atom bomb did not want to believe that it was unnecessary;
  politicians, fianciers and industrialists feared that sympathy
  with the Russian people might encourage communism at home; broad
  masses of white workers, small businessmen, members of the technostructure
  and intellectuals still held the failth propounded by Al Capone:
  'This American system of ours seize it with both hands' and were
  ready to rally round at any suggestion that it was in danger.
  Whatever its causes, the consequence of the Cold War was to provide
  an outlet for government expenditure which did not compete with
  private enterprise and which did not saturate demand by producing
  anything that the public could consume. (85, 86)</P>
  <P>An adequate rate of increase of total output together with
  a reduction in man-hours of work per man-year and a lengthening
  of the period of education enables the system to digest technical
  change which is gradual and widely diffused throughout industry,
  though there does not seem much logic in allowing the 'passive
  and functionless' shareholder to enjoy a large part of the benefit.
  But the profit motive contains no mechanism to ensure that technical
  progress will take digestible forms. (87)</P>
  <P>The mechanization of agriculture in the ex-slave states of
  USA, combined with automation in industry and the atrophy of
  public transport, has made a large part of the unskilled labour
  force redundant to the requirements of profitable industry. The
  concentration of the consequent unemployment on black people
  is creating a horrifying problem. (87)</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>When it is the accepted aim of government policy to preserve
  near-full employment and 'economic growth' which satisfies national
  self-respect and keeps a democracy contented by permitting the
  majority of its citizen a rising level of consumption, then clearly
  the management of industrial firms and the trade unions are just
  as much a part of the administration of the national economy
  as the Civil Service; at the same time democracy has no direct
  means of controlling them; they have to be cajoled and offered
  inducements, or threatened with prohibitions, to get them to
  do what the aims of policy require. ness of raw capitalism and
  has played a large part in saving it, till now, from the doom
  that Marx foresaw a hundred years ago. (90, 91)</P>
  <P>The welfare state, just as much as the needs of 'defence',
  promotes nationalism. Each government is concerned for its own
  people and policy cannot distinguish between benefits to them
  which are absolute and those which are at the expense of other
  peoples. As Myrdal points out, the democratic welfare state in
  the rich countries of the Western world is essentially, by its
  very nature, protectionist and nationalistic. (91, 92)</P>
  <P>The problems which the Soviets are meeting in adapting their
  system to potential affluence are very unlike the problems which
  beset modern capitalist governments in trying to control private
  enterprise. Controlled trade may be clumsy and wasteful but a
  balance of payments problem cannot arise when imports are kept
  to the level that exports can pay for. The elimination of wage
  bargaining permits full employment to be maintained without the
  nuisance of continuously rising money-wage rates and prices.
  Sudden devastating changes in the demand for labour are avoided
  by introducing automation no faster than its consequences can
  be dealth with. The elimination of rentier property (though it
  has not created a classless society) prevents the drain upon
  the investable surplus and the distortions of the pattern of
  demand which are due to the consumption of what our tax collectors
  neatly describe as 'unearned income'. (98)</P>
  <P>The most original and striking of Mao's conceptions concerns
  the relation of the administration and the professions to the
  simple workers. Mao observed in Russia that status becomes the
  basis of privilege when property has been abolished and that,
  through privileged education it can become hereditary, and form
  the basis for class. A Communist party organized in the Stalinist
  tradition creates a gulf between the rulers and the ruled. Moreover,
  in China millineall tradition exalted learning and despised manual
  work. The roots of class, in the administration and the professions,
  remained in the ground after property was cut down, and would
  soon sprout again. The drive for political education based on
  the thought of Mao Tse-tung is intended to dig out the roots
  of privilege, make work honourable, level inequalities and establish
  the right of rank and file to criticize the party and the administration
  in each line of activity. (103)</P>
  <P>The role of the USA in the world today is summed up in an
  old Soviet joke: 'What is the greatest problem facing the president
  of the United States - Is it possible to have capitalism in one
  country?' Every new nationalist movement or reformist political
  party in the Third World is labelled 'communist' and kept out
  of power by force if necessary so that these regimes (with one
  or two precarious exceptions), willingly or reluctantly, keep
  their economies open to trade and investment for the convenience
  of capitalist business and, in many cases, put their territory
  and their forces at the disposal of US strategy. The Cuban revolution
  succeeded in escaping and was obliged to throw itself upon the
  support of the Soviets. The hypothesis that the leadership of
  any kind of revolt against oppression must be 'communist' at
  heart thus becomes self-fulfilling. The obligation to remain
  within the rules of the game of the world market puts a number
  of obstacles in the way of development. The first requirement
  of development is to mobilize an investable surplus. It is against
  the rules to expropriate landlords and make use of rent. The
  profits of native industry are largely consumed in supporting
  a middle-class standard of life. A great part of the profits
  generated by exploiting the natural resources of these countries
  accrues to foreign busiesses which carried out investment to
  open up supplies of raw materials for their home markets before
  native capitalists had arisen to undertake it; a great part,
  also, of the profits generated in industry, trade and finance
  accrues to foreign businesses. To supplement their inadequate
  savings from home sources, many of these countries are receiving
  grants and loans under the title of 'aid'. In some very special
  cases this has succeeded in fostering native capitalism sufficiently
  to begin to look after itself; in most, it leads to dependence
  which inhibits growth rather than promotes it; then loan charges
  mount from year to year; more and more of current aid is being
  eaten up in paying for aid already received. (106, 107)</P>
  <P>'Agriculture is the foundation' The first step out of millenial
  poverty is to raise output per head of foodstuffs. The lack of
  an effective land reform is inimical to development not only
  because it allows the surplus represented by rent to be consumed
  in idleness, but because it checks the potential increase in
  output by leaving land under-utilized and with antiquated techniques,
  discourages the cultivator and often keeps him at such a low
  level that he cannot put much energy into work even if he had
  an incentive to do so, and prevents the mobilization of spare-time
  labour that has proved so effective in China. (107)<!--/SELECTION--></BLOCKQUOTE>
